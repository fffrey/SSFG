Host Madeleine Brand will talk to Hector Tobar of The Los Angeles Times about the story, which he reported from Mexico City.", "utt": ["Here is your dinner-table anecdote for tonight. Three Mexican fishermen who were lost at sea for the last nine months have been found alive and healthy, albeit skinny and sunburned. They survived by eating birds and raw fish and by collecting rainwater. The story is in today's Los Angeles Times. Reporter Hector Tobar joins me now from Mexico City. And, Hector, this is a remarkable story. How were these men found?", "They were found by a Taiwanese crew on a tuna fishing boat that is based in the Marshall Islands. They were found more than halfway between the coast of Mexico and Australia, so they were out there 5,000 miles from the place they had set out from.", "I guess the Taiwanese crew didn't necessarily speak Spanish, and these men didn't necessarily speak Chinese, so how did they communicate?", "The three fishermen wrote their names on a piece of paper, and that paper was faxed from the ship - from the tuna ship to the home base of the ship on the Marshall Islands in the port of Majuro. And that was the way in which the world sort of learned the identify of these men, and the word eventually got back to Mexico that they were alive.", "And tell us more about how they survived these long nine months.", "Well, initially, they told their Chinese rescuers that they survived by capturing sea birds and drinking rain water. They were on a boat that was 27-feet long, so it wasn't exactly a raft, and they did set out apparently for a journey of a couple of weeks initially to do some deep-sea fishing. So they had some initial supplies. One of their grandparents said that they had taken a supply of lemons with them on board, which I guess helped them fight off scurvy, among other things.", "I guess it's a good thing that they were fishermen.", "Yes, and they apparently had all the equipment that, you know -their boat almost sank a couple of times, but otherwise the ship was fine.", "Well speaking of equipment, why didn't they have any equipment that would signal where they were back home or anything, any modern equipment that could help them out?", "Well, many of the fishermen now have cell phones - and cell phones are so cheap to get - and they can call, you know, within 20 or 30 miles of the coastline if they have a problem. But these guys apparently are all in their early 20s, without much money, trying to make a little bit extra. They just really didn't have any equipment whatsoever other than their two outboard motors and their sort of guile, which allowed them to survive.", "And what's been the reaction since they've returned home?", "Well, many of the relatives had given them up for dead, so I think the initial reaction was one of shock. One of the men I interviewed via telephone in San Blas told me he was trembling as he was talking to me, because we had actually been the ones to inform his family that this relative of his had been found. And it was just something so outside the realm of experience for people there.", "Very often men are lost in this area because of the poverty there of the fishermen, and so, you know, people go off into the ocean and they never come back and you don't expect to see them again. And to have someone come back after almost a year was just really seen a real-life miracle.", "Los Angeles Times reporter Hector Tobar in Mexico City.

She says she has private investors interested in the project.", "utt": ["The Trump administration is calling for 1.5 trillion in new spending on infrastructure. The bulk of that money would come from private investors and states and cities. So let's hear reaction now from one city with a big infrastructure problem. Findlay, Ohio sits along the flood-prone Blanchard River. When I spoke with the town's Republican mayor, Lydia Mihalik, I asked her how flood-prone?", "So really, you know, this is something we've been dealing with for the last hundred years. I think, you know, our first major flood happened in 1913. We're very topographically challenged. We like to tell people that we're very flat. And some would think that perhaps the Blanchard River is this, you know, large, deep-flowing river that causes us a lot of trouble.", "But really, it's a very shallow stream. And when we get anywhere between 2 to 3 inches or more of rain in any given storm event, it causes us to flood quite a bit. And we had just begun a study with the Army Corps of Engineers, which basically was a feasibility study that helped develop some solutions for our community. And, you know, we're still working through that process.", "We have taken our project from the Army Corps of Engineers and are now doing it on our own. So it's been a long, long road to hoe, that's for sure.", "Now, you met with President Trump last June. You told him about Findlay and the river and the infrastructure needs. What did he say to you?", "You know, I think the one thing that has been consistent is that President Trump would like to see communities put more into these projects. And a community like Findlay is well-positioned to take advantage of that. But the one thing that we have reminded the White House consistently over the last year about is that not every community is in that position.", "One aspect of the Trump proposal is that the private sector needs to play a role in this infrastructure plan. And that's something you have been pursuing already there in Findlay. Tell me what that looks like. What does the private sector get out of helping you solve the river flooding problem?", "Well, you know, our private sector, when they take a look at what a flooding event actually does in terms of its impact on their ability to just get people into work and deliver goods to market, they want to be involved because there's a business case for it. And we've been very fortunate to have some rather large and small companies, large companies like Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Cooper Tire & Rubber, Whirlpool, you know, they have all been engaged in our flood mitigation strategy.", "The progress, although, you know, we're not as far along as we wanted to be to this point, the progress that we've made so far has a lot to do with the engagement of the private sector.", "I want to let you respond to one of the main criticisms that's being made of the Trump proposal, which is this that it does put the onus for coming up with most of the money on state and local governments. Are there limits to what a city like yours can do? I mean, are you sympathetic to the need for federal vision, for federal money and investment backing up that vision when you think about the country's infrastructure needs?", "You know, I am. Not every space is going to be successful in this endeavor. And, you know, I think there are communities that are giving a lot to Washington in terms of tax dollars. And I think what they're expecting back is not only resources to help us with some of these infrastructure problems but, you know, we have people we have to take care of too.", "There's been a large push not only from the federal government but from states as well for cities to take on a majority of that responsibility. And we have some resources and we do a good job with the resources we've been given. But there is a role to play both at the state and federal level that I think needs to be acknowledged.", "Mayor Mihalik, thank you.", "Yeah, you're welcome.", "That's Lydia Mihalik, the Republican mayor of Findlay, Ohio.

He is an artist and has created artwork before to honor the victims of the Parkland shooting. He built today's creation piece by piece.", "So did the rally have a central message that you could hear, something that everybody seemed to support or rally around?", "There were a lot of different talking points, but the one thing everyone kept going back to was the desire to have universal background checks for gun owners. A lot of people were actually wearing T-shirts that said, we are the 97, alluding to the fact that 97 percent of the American people supposedly support universal background checks for gun owners. One of the people wearing one of those T-shirts was Lizzie Simpson, and she's a high school sophomore in Texas.", "As a high schooler, I'm scared everyday of going to school and if that's the last time I'm going to see my parents, if that's the last time I'm going to see my best friend. That needs to stop. There needs to be at least a beginning point where we as students, as parents, as church leaders, as people of the United States come out and say enough is enough.

This form is a chiasmus, a highfalutin poetic name for the X, or sight of the cross. This is fitting because Marshall's book is about handshakes and code words, about crossing and re-crossing his home landscape, the Wild Hundreds, a neighborhood in far South Side Chicago between 100th and 130th streets. It's a landscape punctuated by fame, food and liquor and what Marshall calls the down-home migration taste of Harold's Chicken Shack. In Marshall's hands, it's also a place of ambition, ambition cut short, of love letters and hood words and pallbearers. Poems condense around what Marshall calls their percussive imperative, around bittersweet vignettes - trying to buy shoes, trying to graduate, trying to fit in at smart camp. There's also the ambivalence of making it to college, of being able to look back and hold up a mirror to a place you've survived. Marshall casts his streets in a variety of inventive forms - poems as palindromes, as Facebook posts and also as sonnets or villanelles. Reading Marshall, it's impossible not to remember Gwendolyn Brooks circling another South Side Chicago neighborhood in her 1945 classic, \"A Street In Bronzeville.\" In that book, a collage of voices captures a neighborhood hemmed in by poverty and racism.

And, Steve, have you been taking full advantage of Cyber Monday?", "Well, I actually was doing some work getting ready for this interview.", "No, not shopping, not shopping.", "No. No. I haven't been shopping. But I also had a theory that Cyber Monday might not matter that much anymore. You know, so many people I know take their smartphones with them when they go shopping, and they're comparison shopping at stores over Thanksgiving weekend. And I kind of wondered if that meant that Cyber Monday would just disappear.", "Well, it turns out my theory is totally wrong. Even though more people are using smartphones in sort of brick-and-mortar shops, Cyber Monday is still a big deal for many of the same reasons that Black Friday is a big deal. It's a chance for shoppers to find bargains, but this time online.", "So special deals today are driving a lot of people online. ComScore, which tracks Internet traffic, expects today to be the biggest online shopping day ever, with something close to one and a half billion dollars in sales, 20 percent more than last year. So we'll see if they are right. But in the meantime, it's pretty clear that smartphones have already changed the way millions of people shop. They were using them to buy online over the holiday weekend and comparison shops. So that probably took a bite out of sales at brick-and-mortar stores.", "And how are those brick-and-mortar stores responding to that?", "Well, the biggest ones, the most technologically savvy ones are trying to embrace the smartphone. They've been building apps for a while for their own stores, and they're encouraging customer to use them. And really what they're after is all the kinds of information they can get from your cell phone.", "For example, Wal-Mart's has an app that uses your location information to know which store you're in. And then it doesn't what merchandise is in store around you. If something you want is out of stock, then it can guide you to its online store. Other stores actually keep track of how long you have been in their stores, and they'll send you coupons for every few minutes you're there.", "So all of these apps are really designed to keep customers from wondering, both digitally and physically. And the thing about smartphones that make them so frightening to retailers, though, is that it makes it so easy for you to wander, at least digitally, and comparison shop almost endlessly just with your thumbs.", "And, Steve, do you have favorite sites that you go to for comparison shopping?", "Yeah, I do. I have a couple. One is called Milo and it allows businesses to get their inventories online. So you can see what stores around you have in stock. And they've done a really good job of reaching out to small businesses, so I like it for that reason. The other site I like a lot is Decide.com. And this site was built by a computer scientist who studies dynamic pricing. And it tries to predict whether or not the price of certain gadgets and other goods will drop.

I feel compelled to adhere to this      position, especially related to my own nomination.  Protection of the      prerogatives of the executive branch and continued pursuit of my      confirmation are intentioned.  I have decided that seeking my      confirmation should yield.'", "This decision comes after heavy criticism of her nomination and      questions about her suitability for the job.  And with us now to talk      about all of this is Dahlia Lithwick, a legal analyst for the online      magazine Slate and for DAY TO DAY.  This issue, Dahlia, of executive      privilege, could it be a pretext here do you think?", "Oh, absolutely, Noah.  I think this was always lurking under the surface.      The only reason it came out now I think is because the nomination was is      in such trouble.  This was an idea floated by Charles Krauthammer, the      columnist, suggesting this was the, quote, \"exit strategy\" that could get      the Bush administration and Harriet Miers out and still save face rather      than have a fight about her character and qualifications.  We could have      a fight about constitutional prerogatives, whether the executive branch      or, in fact, the Senate Judiciary Committee could see those papers.  It's      a much more attractive fight than the fight about whether Harriet Miers      is a flaming liberal.", "Well, hardly a flaming liberal, but, nonetheless, this nomination      seemed to be in trouble almost from the time it was announced.  Remind us      of the early criticisms of Miers and where they came from.", "The first two strains of criticism actually came from the far      right, and they were, one, that she was a crony, that she had no      experience other than having essentially been in George Bush's employee      for the last 10 years and was fiercely loyal.  And as you'll remember,      there was a lot of talk--this is what the Federalist Papers warned      against--the president can't just, you know, pick his best friends and      put them into office.  The other thing that was immediately a problem      with this nomination was that she had no record.  The president tried to      talk in code about her.  He talked a lot about her heart.  He talked      about her religion, but he had no concrete evidence to point to the fact      that she was going to be the sort of reliable conservative that the far      right wanted.  So essentially they were expecting a far-right sort of      activist who was going to get on the court and overturn Roe v. Wade, and      instead of giving them that, the president gave them someone who he      promised, based on his own knowledge, would do that and that just was      never enough.", "Now a deep breath at the White House.  There are other      difficulties there at the end of this week, but when do you expect a new      name to come forward and who do you think that might be?", "The White House is saying it's going to be shortly.  Certainly      their short list now with Miers' name off it is still in place.  I think      that there's a good possibility, given that the base, the far political      right, really sort of smelled blood in the water and now they know how      much power they have over this nomination.  They're going to clamor for      the person they wanted in the first place.  So there's a very good chance      that we're going to see a Priscilla Owen from the 5th Circuit, a Janice      Rogers Brown from the DC Circuit, a Michael Luttig from the 4th Circuit.      All of those are names of people who are extremely reliable, predictable      conservatives who have said in one way or another and have long judicial      records to show that they're going to sort of start that right-wing      counter revolution on the Supreme Court that Bush's base has been waiting      for.", "In the meantime, Sandra Day O'Connor has to work a few more      months there.", "That's right, Noah.  She's certainly on the court, but it's      important to understand that once her replacement is seated, she can't      vote on cases.  Her replacement is going to have a tough time voting      because they didn't hear oral arguments.

Michel Martin is away. We're going to start the program today with politics because this was a week of significant wins for Republicans. They've got a new tax bill signed into law and passed a temporary spending bill that keeps the government open through the first three weeks of the new year. The cherry on top for them - it adds $4 billion to the missile defense budget. But that fix is only in place until January 19, after which, Congress is supposed to come up with a durable long-term budget to get the country through the rest of the fiscal year. With me now to talk about the likelihood of that actually happening is NPR's congressional reporter Kelsey Snell. Welcome.", "Hi. Thanks for having me.", "So let's jump right in. First off, what did Congress agree to in order to get to enough of that agreement to keep the government open until the 19?", "Mainly, the bill includes government funding to keep everything at about the exact same spending level as it is right now until January 19. It also includes funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program to keep that program running until March. There's also the reauthorization of a controversial section of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, it allows wiretapping without an open warrant. And there's also a reauthorization of the Veterans Choice insurance program. So it keeps a lot of things going, and it gives them more time to negotiate.", "Now since there's a big congressional vacation in the middle of this, really, January 19 is not that far away. Are they going to be able to get an actual long-term spending bill together in that time?", "Well, it's entirely possible that we will see them have to pass another short-term spending bill before they can get to a long-term spending agreement. I've talked to the appropriators who write the spending bills and they say that they're making progress on a spending agreement but they're not quite there yet. And that's made a little bit more difficult because the House announced that they're going to be coming back on January 8 instead of right after New Year's. So they are taking even more time for vacation, and that could extend the negotiations even further.", "And immigration has been a contentious issue for years in Washington, how is it involved in getting the two big parties to agree to a long-term spending plan?", "Democrats want a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 700,000 people who are here in the country illegally but were brought here as children. Now, part of this is that Democrats say they won't sign on to a long-term spending agreement until there is an immigration agreement in place. They've been saying that they wouldn't leave town without a deal but they did. And there are a lot of activists who are really frustrated that they didn't follow through. Leaders I've talked to including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer say the conversations are going well and they believe these are good-faith talks.", "There are members on both sides of the aisle who say that this is a priority. This is something that has to get done - how come it still hasn't?", "Well, there are some disagreements about what both sides want. But in order to get to a long term path to citizenship for these DREAMers, Republicans want to see increased border security, and that's something Democrats have agreed to in the past. But typically, that means electronic surveillance and monitoring systems and upkeep of existing infrastructure along the border, not increasing detention centers or the number of agents who carry out deportations. And that's a big point of conflict between Democrats and Republicans, trying to figure all of that out.", "Now, Republicans want to avoid a big fight over money for a physical wall along the border. And we just don't really know where the president is on that right now. It was a major campaign request of his but it's not something he's been talking about lately.", "And Mitch McConnell, I mean, he's one of the central figures in all of this. There are signals from Chuck Schumer that they're ready to provide more money for security. Where's McConnell on all of this?", "Well, McConnell told us in that interview this week that he does think that an agreement on immigration will happen.", "The president has actually incentivized us by putting a time limit on the DACA program to see what we can agree to. And there are constructive bipartisan discussions going on. Already, I put together a group to address that issue, and we have until March to do that and I'm confident we will.", "As Senator McConnell notes, some of the urgency was built in by President Trump himself by rescinding the executive action that created the program in the first place to be replaced by legislation. So, really, Congress must act.", "Right. When President Trump did rescind that, he said that he didn't believe the executive order was legal. And so he's put the onus on Congress to make a new law. And he angered many people in his base when he talked about working with Democrats to get that done. So Democrats are working on it.

It's going to be America first. It's America first.", "That was in October. Now, yesterday, White House officials told numerous news organizations that the U.S. was about to withdraw from NAFTA, which turned out to be a head fake. Last night, the president told his Mexican and Canadian counterparts he is not pulling out of the agreement at this time, but he would like to renegotiate.", "All right. So what does renegotiate mean? We're going to talk about that with Domenico Montanaro here in our studios. Hi, Domenico.", "Hey there, Rachel.", "So some mixed messages coming out of the White House yesterday. What's going on?", "No question about it. I mean, as Steve mentioned, earlier in the day, the White House was threatening to scrap NAFTA by executive order. Now, it's not clear you can actually do all of that by executive order, but the threat was enough to make the Mexican and Canadian leaders stand up and take notice and say, what is going on here? You had the Canadian president, Justin Trudeau, call the White House twice. You had the Mexican peso plummet on the news that there could even be the possibility that something would happen. Later that night, Donald Trump spoke with Canada's Trudeau and with Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico and said, nope, not going to scrap NAFTA right now, but I do want to bring NAFTA up to date through renegotiation. And if I could just say, this isn't completely brand new. You know, while we play the clip of Donald Trump saying he wants to scrap NAFTA, he's also been saying that he wants to renegotiate NAFTA.", "So is that just a tactic? Is that just something the president likes to do, like give this opening salvo that's really extreme knowing full well that he can negotiate in the middle somewhere?", "Well, I don't know if he knows full well he can negotiate in the middle. I think he hopes that he can negotiate in the middle. But it's not clear that he is able to do that. And I think you're starting to see - or not starting to see. I think this hundred days has shown us what happens when you put a transactional person in charge of the presidency. This is somebody who's used to real estate deals in New York where you can just say to your other partner, OK, you know, I don't like how much you offered here. I want X amount, and then you have something in the middle maybe. This is far more complicated than that, affecting investors, infecting - affecting trade, you know, and Trump has talked about this deficit of trade between the U.S. and Mexico in particular. But, you know, trade with Mexico has actually increased sixfold from the United States since NAFTA was put in place.", "So do we know what renegotiation would look like, what would change?", "It's not totally clear. We have heard that Wilbur Ross, who's the commerce secretary, would likely be somebody who would be in charge of some start of those negotiations. You saw him be somebody who was out front this week, too, when he was talking about Canadian softwood lumber. And you had the Canadian very polite smackdown of we strongly disagree.", "Can we just remember that it takes more than one person to negotiate? It takes two or, in this case, three nations to negotiate. And Mexicans have been saying for months, if it came to this, they don't want to renegotiate NAFTA, that they've been urging a number of Mexican current and former officials, have been urging the country, to just say no because negotiation would create uncertainty and stop business investment in Mexico. Now, this little threat that the president effectively made yesterday might cause Mexicans and Canadians to reconsider that. But there's going to be a lot of resistance to changing the terms of this deal.", "Yeah. OK. Domenico Montanaro of NPR's Politics team. Domenico, thanks as always.", "A pleasure as always, Rachel.", "We've been talking a lot about the rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea, but we're going to look at that conflict from a different angle this morning.", "The angle of China. Look at a map, and China is right beside North Korea, of course. It is North Korea's only friend and only sponsor, and President Trump insisted in January that China could force North Korea to behave.", "China has total control. Believe me. They say they don't. They have total control over North Korea, and China should solve that problem. And if they don't solve the problem, we should make trade very difficult for China.", "That problem being North Korea's nuclear program, its threats against its neighbors, even the United States. Since then, though, the president has shifted tone. After meeting with China's president, he agreed that North Korea is hard to manage. He spoke of China getting better trade terms from the United States if it helps with North Korea. Though, it's still going to be difficult because of that border.", "So guess what. Our own Rob Schmitz has actually seen that border. In fact, he can see North Korea right now, maybe, from his hotel room. He is in the Chinese border city of Dandong. Hey, Rob.", "Hey, Rachel. How are you doing?", "Can you see it right now?", "Can you - I want to know if you can see Russia from there actually.", "I can't.", "Go on, go on.", "(Laughter) It's not that clear outside.", "OK.", "But I can see North Korea. Yeah, it's...", "What does it look like from where you're at?", "Well, you know, it's sunny and clear here. The Yalu River is just below me, and beyond that is Sinuiju, one of North Korea's largest cities with a few hundred thousand people. And there is a very big difference between this side of the river and that one. The Chinese side is full of luxury high-rises, and the North Korean side is what you might expect - factories, smokestacks, drab-colored residential buildings and lots of farmland. At night, when you look at the North Korean side, you wouldn't even know that there's a city there - it's just dark - while on this side of the river, it sort of looks like Vegas. It's lit up with flashing neon lights. There was even a fireworks display last night, and the river walkway is sort of filled with tourists.", "So what do they say? When you talk to people who live there or tourists, how do they perceive what's going on in North Korea right now?", "Well, you know, I spoke to a lot of them and, you know, they love it here. I mean, because of that, the city has a very festive atmosphere. Most of the tourists here would qualify as China's new middle class. So they may not be able to afford trips to the U.S. or Europe yet, but they're traveling within China, and a border town like this is sort of a taste for the exotic for them. It's sort of like American tourists in the 1960s heading to Tijuana for their first look at a foreign country. Many people told me yesterday that North Korea reminds them of what China used to look like in the 1980s, and it gives them a sense of how far China has come since then. So they seem pretty happy about that. But when you talk to folks here in the tourism industry, I got a sense that some of them were a little worried about rising tensions between the U.S. and their neighbor. I spoke with restaurant owner Li Juin (ph) about this, and here's what she said.", "(Foreign language spoken).", "So Li's saying here that she's worried. If war breaks out, she says, nobody's going to come here anymore and that if she heard about war in a place that she wanted to visit, she wouldn't go either.", "What does all this tell you about the degree to which China has any leverage, could pressure North Korea?", "Well, you know, outside my window here is this very large bridge called the China-Korea Friendship Bridge, and this is a lifeline for North Korea. Seventy percent of all the North's foreign trade passes over this single bridge. And during the morning, the trucks are filled with goods that drive from China to North Korea. In the afternoon, they come back from North Korea into China. I think that to the extent that what the U.S. could do is, you know, the Trump administration obviously is putting a lot of pressure on China to do something. China did clamp down on coal. But if it wanted to really do something, I think it would probably put some pressure on this single bridge below me...", "Interesting.", "...Preventing goods from going across.", "NPR's Rob Schmitz.", "And a good reminder there that while China does have leverage in this situation, the leverage is no different really than it has been for years and years.", "Rob, thanks so much for joining us this morning.", "Thanks a lot, Rachel.", "Fess up, Steve Inskeep, you ever text when you're behind the wheel?", "Long pause.", "(Laughter).", "If, hypothetically, I did text behind the wheel, I would not be alone...", "Yeah.", "...Because the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that every day some three-quarters of a million or two-thirds of a million - 660,000 - people use their electronic devices while driving - not so safe. To get people to stop, lawmakers in New York want to give police a device called a Textalyzer. Let's let Debbie Hersman of the National Safety Council explain it.", "The Textalyzer is going to be a game changer when it comes to handheld devices and potentially even in-vehicle systems. It will be the breathalyzer of our electronics.", "NPR's David Schaper is covering this story. He's on the line from Chicago. Hi David.", "Good morning.", "Is it that complicated? I mean, why do you need a Textalyzer? Can't a police officer just look at my phone to see if I've been texting before an accident?", "Actually, they can't, and there's Supreme Court precedent that protects you from from allowing police to access your phone. So under the legislation that's being considered in New York that would be the first state to allow the use of this textnology (ph), police would only be allowed to ask for your phone...", "Did you just say textnology? I think you did say that.", "I kind of, yeah, flubbed there.", "Go on, go on. No, no, no, that's actually a creative word. Go on.", "Yeah, maybe it's a new buzzword. They'd only be able to get to your phone after a crash, and then officers would attach a cord, like a USB, to connect to their laptop or their iPad. And this software would then scan the phone to see how you were using it, if you were on it at all and if it was an incoming call or an outcoming call or if you were tapping out a text or even swiping left or right on some dating app. And then it would have a timestamp so you can compare that to the timing of the crash. And it's still being developed. It's not fully operational yet, but when it is, it will be tailored to the laws of the state or the jurisdiction that it's approved in. So that means that, you know, it would be able to differentiate through use - from uses that are legal, such as maybe GPS or something like using the phone hands free, which is allowed in most states.", "Interesting. And also I imagine part of the problem, or part of what they want it to do, is to become some kind of deterrent, right?", "Can't wait for that moment when the policeman asks my phone to breathe into the device.", "Ha ha ha.

But there is a long history of groups before them facing discrimination.", "utt": ["The holy month of Ramadan is about to begin. That's the period of fasting, introspection and prayer observed by Muslims around the world, including here in the U.S. We wanted to spend a few minutes reflecting on what it's like to be a Muslim in America. And for this, we turn to a familiar voice on this program. Arsalan Iftikhar is a human rights lawyer, a writer and an activist.", "Over the years, he's become a go-to voice in American media, playing a variety of roles - explaining Islam, decrying Islamic extremism and also what he sees as rising islamophobia. It is that last which concerns him in a new book, and the title sums up its mission. It's called \"Scapegoats: How Islamophobia Helps Our Enemies And Threatens Our Freedoms.\" And I began our conversation by asking him to talk about the word islamophobia.", "Generally speaking, islamophobia has come to mean a hatred of anything related to Islam and Muslims. And it's important to keep in mind that if you look at the civil rights history of the United States, every minority group in America has been scapegoats. And tomorrow, it'll be somebody else. And so that's the key thing here, is that, you know, when you look at the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, it's not only the Muslim ban that he's called for. He's called for building a wall against Latinos and said disparaging remarks against African-Americans.", "The point here is that we as Americans need to focus on the things that bring us together as Americans and not things that separate us. And I feel like - as though we have always had scapegoats in the past. We have scapegoats currently. And I believe that Islam and Muslims are the current scapegoats in America today.", "Well, in fact, in the book you write about Germans during World War I who were targets of harassment. You said at the time that they were actually the largest minority group in the United States - that German-language newspapers were shut down, German-American religious services were disrupted. You write that a German immigrant in Illinois was actually lynched after having been accused of stealing dynamite. And then of course, during World War II, the internment of the Japanese, which is something that a lot of people are familiar with. Why do you think that is?", "Well, I think that as an American society, we've always needed a proverbial bogeyman. I think politicians have used bogeymen to further their own political agendas, whether it's Catholics that were coming across the pond at the turn of the 20th century to German-Americans to Japanese-Americans to anti-Semitism to Jim Crow and African-American - the African-American civil rights movement. And I think that now, in the post-9/11 civil rights era that we live in, I believe that Islam and Muslims are being used as a scapegoat. And I think that many politicians are trying to score cheap political points, and I think that Donald Trump is a perfect example of that.", "Now I want to talk about the second part of the title of the book, though, which is that it helps our enemies and threatens our freedoms. That's what you say islamophobia does. I mean, the premise of your book is that there is a broader, corrosive effect on the society if that mentality is maintained. Tell me why you think that.", "Well, because as I look at American history, right? Because even though the fill-in-the-blanks is Muslims today, tomorrow it could be anyone else. I mean, when the USA Patriot Act came out in 2001, you know, this was a 348-page document that trumped 50 federal laws. And it wasn't just targeted at brown Muslims who were suspected of terrorism. This allows the federal government to come in and, without a warrant, get all of your information without even notifying you, going to college registrars, getting all their information. I mean, it affects everybody.", "You know, political rhetoric leads to laws. And that's important to keep in mind, is that again, you know, the internment camps of World War II didn't come out of a vacuum. You had people - President Roosevelt's general, who was the head of Pacific Command, James DeWitt, was quoted in Congress as saying once a Jap, always a Jap. I mean, this sort of anti-Japanese rhetoric was actually what led to the internment camps.", "And that's the thing, is that, you know, we can't just see this as, you know, ha ha, this is just kind of silly political rhetoric that's coming out. This could - you know, if somebody - if Donald Trump comes out tomorrow and says, you know, we should put Muslims in internment camps - well, you know, we've had them in the past. Who's to say that we can't have them again in the future?", "Do things like the recent election of Sadiq Khan as London's mayor, the first Muslim to lead a major Western capital - does that give you any sense of hope?", "Yes, it absolutely does. I mean, the election of Sadiq Khan by the people of London is a great sign not only for multiculturalism in the United Kingdom and in London in particular, but again, it's a gut-punch to people who might pander in these homophobic memes and to the extremists themselves. I mean, you know, here you have a man who was the son of a bus driver who had emigrated from Pakistan over 50 years ago. He worked his way up, became a human rights lawyer and now is the mayor of one of the largest cities in the world.", "And he's a practicing Muslim who's said that he's going to be a feminist mayor, that he's going to speak out against anti-Semitism, that he's going to, you know, be a mayor for all Londoners. And that's the thing, is that, you know, we Muslims are just trying to contribute to our respective societies in whatever ways that we can.", "And I think that as long as people understand that we are as diverse and we're not a monolith, just like no other group wants to be seen as a monolith, I think that we can begin to have that humanizing conversation in order to move our societies forward.", "That's Arsalan Iftikhar. He's an international human rights lawyer. He's a regular commentator in the media. And his new book is called \"Scapegoats: How Islamophobia Helps Our Enemies And Threatens Our Freedoms,\" and it's out now. And he was with us in our Washington, D.C. studios.

Tell us about that.", "Yeah, so there's lots of these giant piles of ash, and it's potentially toxic. And now it's like a toxic slush with the rain that's turned to this, like, really thick mud.

And, you know, emergency crews say they're doing everything they can to make sure it doesn't contaminate local waterways in the Paradise area.

I had gone into college when I was 17, and so I knew that I would have that extra subsidy per month as long as I was in school.", "The student loan.", "Well, it wasn't quite a student loan. There was a subsidy that stayed in effect until I was 21. The trick is that I didn't graduate by the time I was 21, and so I was suddenly left without that income stream and ended up relying entirely on student loans.", "And that can be tricky.", "It can be very tricky. I went on from there to graduate school, still relying on student loans. And now I'm struggling because even though I'm a working professional in an executive director job at a nonprofit, I have over $200,000 in loan debt that I have to figure out how to pay back.", "And, of course, a lot of people have that problem, but it's certainly not easy for anybody. I wonder, as you were considering this problem when you were 18 and then again at 21, did you feel abandoned?", "Well, of course I did, right? Because I had - you know, I didn't have parents that were paying for school for me like other people were. I didn't feel as though there was anyone there really looking out for my interests, and I really felt as though at 18, all the decisions that I needed to make were encumbered on me without any wise advice.", "And is there a special feeling of accomplishment now that you've gotten to where you are?", "Oh, I think certainly. I just would go back and have, obviously, you know, done it on a little bit more of a maybe fiscally responsible manner.", "And maybe that five-year college program.", "Right, right. No, without any question. And so I think, you know, I would go back and attribute that to say, well, I accomplished a lot on my own two feet, but really, I would probably be in a much better situation had I had responsible, loving, caring adults helping me with those decisions.", "Joy, thanks very much, and congratulations.", "Thank you.", "Good luck with those loans.", "Thanks. Bye.", "Bye-bye. Joining us now is Mark Courtney. He is research and development director of Partners For Our Children at the University of Washington School of Social Work. He's been following youth who have aged out of foster care since 2002, lead researcher for a new report from Partners for our Children and Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago. Thanks very much for being here with us in Studio 3A today.", "Good to be here.", "And Joy, who we heard from, and Jeremy, who we heard from, they are -well, it's nice to hear from them, but they're exceptions.", "Well, they're exceptions, but they actually represent an important group. I mean, we've been following 700 young people for a number of years now, from 17 at this point to 23, 24, and on average, yes, young people transitioning from foster care as a group aren't faring well.", "They're - less than half of them are employed at 23, very high rates of involvement with the criminal justice system, lots of struggling parents, rely on public assistance. But they're - you know, actually Joy and Jeremy represent maybe as many as half of the young people aging out that are doing okay, but struggling to do okay.", "They're working really hard. They finished high school, and they have some college. It sounds like Joy has, you know, more than some college.", "More than some, and more than some debt, too.", "Yeah, and that's unusual. I mean, we find, you know, only about six percent of young people we're talking to at 23, 24 have any kind of college degree.", "And more than four times more likely than that not to have a high school degree.", "That's right. That's right. The young men are six times more likely than their peers to be convicted of a crime. One-quarter of the population are really struggling parents who are barely making ends meet. They're still parenting, they haven't lost their kids.", "And then we've got a big group that, in fact, have lost their kids, have been involved in the criminal system, et cetera. So I think the trick is following the philosophy that Joy and Jeremy are talking about, is to continue to be a parent, in a sense.", "The child welfare system took these young people away from their parents and kind of abandons that role at 18. And like any family, you've got a range of the family, some that are going to go right to college, some that are going to need a lot of help. I think that's true of these young people, as well.", "Jeremy, let me ask you: What do you tell foster youth as they approach their 18th birthday, people who may not have been as fortunate as you?", "I pretty much just tell them that, I mean, even though that life has thrown a lot of unfortunate circumstances your way, if you have the mental capacity and hopefully the proper connections, you can easily overcome them and become successful in whichever way you choose.", "Easily?", "Not always easily, but for some people, like six percent of us do have those connections that are definitely going to help us get there.", "And the emotional part of it - yes, it's a lot of hard work, but the emotional part of it, for so many people, that feeling of abandonment - of course, Joy mentioned it. There's not much you can do about it, but there it is. And the huge responsibilities: a lot of well, responsible adults, theoretically, have problems getting their laundry done on time, much less kids suddenly thrown out on their own at the age of 18.", "Yeah.", "What's there to say about that? Yes, of course.", "It's definitely unfortunate. I think with the emotional state, I was fortunate enough in foster care to be placed in therapy, which really helped me. It definitely got my emotional state where I was capable of handling any situation.", "All right. Let's get another caller in on the conversation. April joins us from Minneapolis.", "Oh, hi, Neal. How is it going today?", "Oh, not too bad.", "Excellent. I was very fortunate. When I got kicked out of foster care at age 18, I had a phenomenal social worker because, you know, I was completely terrified. I had no life skills. I wasn't taught anything. You know, I didn't have any job or anything that I could fall back on.", "And my social worker, because, you know, he had - his own county would not let me stay in the foster care system because I was not in college. He found - he went out. He found another home, a foster care home, that was sitting unused in another county, and he basically got special dispensation from his bosses to basically funnel me money every month, and then I would just pay these people as boarders in their household.", "So I wasn't in the foster care system, but I was still renting. You know, I still had a place to stay. I still had a roof over my head. And that six months that I got with that home made all the difference in the world to me.", "I was - you know, instead of being forced to, you know, get any job I could, a minimum wage job, get into drug dealing, get into whatever I could to, you know, have food and a roof over my head, instead I was able to, you know, get a nice job, you know, in a stable company.", "And because of that, you know, I have a great job now. I'm married. My life is really awesome. You know, if it wasn't for that social worker who really, like, stuck his neck out, I would have been - I would have been lost, like most foster kids who get kicked out of the system.", "And I hope you invite him every Thanksgiving.", "Oh, I do. In fact, I'm one of the few kids that he still sees on a regular basis. You know, I just saw an article in the New York Times about, you know, about how few foster kids actually make it, you know, after they get kicked out of foster care.", "He said I was one of just a handful of the thousands of kids he's seen, you know, who made it into the University of Minnesota and who's actually been successful, which is really sad. But he's one of my best friends, and I, you know, I basically consider him my dad at this point.", "Well, you should. It sounds like he really went out of his way to help. April, thanks so much, and continued good luck to you.", "Thank you very much, Neal. You have a great day now.", "You, too. And Mark Courtney, that's another heartwarming story, but by the edge of her - the skin of her teeth, a social worker willing to go out on the edge.", "Yeah. We certainly need people like that. We need adults in the lives of these young people to help them negotiate this transition to adulthood. But we don't want to rely on the good graces of that, and I think...", "Of happenstance. Yes, there ought to be a system for that.", "Right. And you hear her worker says you're the exception, really. And I think that the trick is for us to get more serious about having policies that increase the likelihood that young people who actually could go on to college - I think almost half of these young people probably could pretty much immediately go to college. They're not. You've got some exceptions that do.", "So there are some things we can do to support them in terms of continued housing, support, adults in their lives. But right now, almost everywhere in the country basically kicks these young people out at 18.", "The handful of places that don't - one of which, Illinois, is in our study - I think do a much better job of ensuring those kinds of connections are there. And you begin to see more young people going to school, less homelessness right off the bat at 18, delayed pregnancies, when you continue to act like a parent - you know, when we as a society, through our child welfare system, continue to act like a parent.", "Well, there's some questions about the efficacy of that extra help, from 18 to 21. Of course, from 18 to 21, they're going to do better. After that, they don't seem to do much better than the kids who got out at 18.", "Well, we've looked at a few things. I mean, for example, it looks like extending care - now, we only have Illinois. Let's be clear. This is one approach to extending care to 21. But it looks like it delays homelessness, doesn't prevent it altogether.", "It looks like - in fact, young people are more likely to have college. They're much more likely to have some college by the age of 23, 24, if they were allowed to remain in care. But they're not necessarily more likely to have a degree by then. So I think it's a mixed story.", "We'll continue talking about the new research on kids who age out of foster care and continue to talk with Jeremy Long, one of the success stories, about to graduate from college in Colorado.", "Stay with us. We want to hear from you. If you have aged out of foster care, tell us your story: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan, TALK OF THE NATION, NPR News.", "This is TALK OF THE NATION. Im Neal Conan in Washington.", "Since 2002, researchers have been following some 700 youth in foster care. They interviewed the kids at various times as they got older to get a sense of what happens to these young people when they leave foster care. Results are not encouraging.", "While some young people do well and manage to find jobs and housing and schooling, far too many end up homeless, drop out of school, are unemployed. Sadly, many of them end up convicted of a crime.", "Our focus today is what happens to youth when they age out of foster care. We want to hear from you if that is your story. Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. What happened to you when you left the system? What made a difference? What might have helped?", "Our guests are Jeremy Long, who aged out of foster care three years ago, a member now of Bridging the Gap Youth Leadership Board in Denver, working with current and former foster youth and about to graduate from the University of Northern Colorado.", "Also with us, Mark Courtney, who conducted a lot of that research that we're talking about. He works at the University of Washington School of Social Work and a lead researcher on that report at the Chapin Hall and the University of Chicago. They're both with us here in Studio 3A. Let's get another caller on the line and go to Michael, Michael calling us from Portland, Oregon.", "Hi, long-time listener, first-time caller.", "Thank you for that.", "I worked with children in foster care for 15 years, teenagers, and the issue is more than aging out. We had the IOP program, the independent living program, which by law when a child is 16 in foster care, they can voluntarily participate in the program to teach them the skills they will need to become independent adults.", "The problem was that the system is set up so that they don't get what they need, which is stability, predictability and consistency. The workload is so heavy that workers change all the time. They not only change foster homes, they change workers.", "So kids never get to establish that adult - because when you're a social worker with this group or population of kids, you are effectively a surrogate father. And when you don't have the opportunity to stay with kids and support them through - and particularly, all across the country, they have cut mental health services to these kids.", "And I see Mark Courtney, you're shaking your head in agreement.", "They get to see a therapist now, every other week, and then the therapist changes all the time.", "I just wanted to get a comment from Mark Courtney on this.", "I think that this is  he points out something very important, that the young people in care, in addition to coming in care with lots of challenges. I mean, one thing that the audience might not understand is that most of these young people aging out actually came into care as adolescents.", "So they were in difficult situations, troubled homes for a long time. Then they come into care, and quite often, they do bounce around a lot. They don't necessarily get all the help they need. And in our research, some of the most important predictors we see of later success, are things like being on track in school, having your mental health needs addressed while you're in care, and the kind of social support you get from adults.", "But I think we have to keep in mind, most of these young people actually have families. So it's a bit tricky, right. It's not the case that they're orphans, and they don't have families. They came into care as adolescents.", "And so we need to help them maintain the healthy relationships that exist in their family, but then also as this person was saying - obviously a really long-time social worker - we have to be surrogate parents, as well, and it's complicated because they have a lot of people in their lives.", "Jeremy, you went into foster care at age 13, correct?", "Yes.", "And then later had the advantage of therapy.", "I did, and it was actually a nice situation for me. I was one of those fortunate youth that I had two therapists, but that was over the span of four years. And the reason my first one left was because of retirement, and then we went into another one, who was very stable and was there until the end.", "So very helpful to you, and would you recommend it for a lot of the kids in your situation?", "I would. I would say it's definitely helped me a lot.", "All right, thank you. Michael, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.", "Thank you.", "Bye-bye. Let's go next to Michelle(ph), Michelle calling us from San Francisco.", "Hi, Neal, thanks for having me.", "Sure, go ahead please.", "So I came out of foster care when I was 17, went into college only because of foster care, pretty much. My parents didn't go to school. So that helped. That was a benefit. I got a job over at the dorms, where I pretty much paid for my living there. So that saved me a lot.", "But I really wish that I would have had a network of other alumni, foster care alumni, just to know that I'm not alone, that it's okay that I don't do my laundry all the time, that, you know, I am late on rent. But it really was a challenge knowing, deciding  and I didn't learn until I was 26, that you can't have it all. You can't have a car and have an apartment, have a job and go to school at the same time. One of them has to stop.", "So I'm trying to do, for my part, is I've had a radio show for a little bit on the Internet, called \"Independent Party.\" But, so I'm trying to do something to just for that group. But there's nothing really out there as far as I was aware of, of other foster care kids who were making it and what decisions they had. I mean, there wasn't too many role models available. It was pretty much fend for yourself.", "And Mark Courtney, that sounds like a great idea, that foster kids could help support each other, and are you involved in that, Jeremy?", "I am. I'm actually a member of the Foster Care Alumni Association of America, which is based around foster care alumni coming together and discussing their successful stories, if not...", "And how would people like Michelle find other people in her situation?", "Yeah, how can I get involved?", "Yeah, definitely. Definitely check out the Web site, which I believe is FCAA.org. And then also an organization called Foster Club. It's an online national network for youth that have been in  that are in care and that have been in care. And there's people aged 15, all the way until 80, that'll definitely discuss stories with you.", "And if your pencil wasn't out, Michelle, we'll get that information and post a link to it on our Web site at npr.org.", "I appreciate that. Thank you.", "And good luck with the radio show, Michelle. There's a future in that.", "Thank you.", "Bye-bye. Let's see if we can go next to  this is Lacey(ph), Lacey with us from Winston-Salem.", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Hi, good afternoon.", "I aged out of foster care in 1993 at the age of 21, and the thing that made me able to age out at 21 was because I was in school at the time. Actually, I had got kicked out of three semesters, but then I went on to do volunteer work, and I was kind of working and, you know, being independent, and so I was able to remain until I was 21.", "But it definitely is a very scary prospect when you get to that point that you know that your time is coming up, and you know, you've got  you're counting down the months and the weeks and the days, and then, you know, it's kind like a void on the other side of that birthday.", "You knew that, in a way, you were alone, but not like that.", "Right, yeah, absolutely. And one of the guests mentioned that, you know, there's nothing to go back to. And it's really true that, you know, most people, most people who leave home after the age of 18, 19 or 21, if they fall on hard times, they have a family that they can possibly go back to sometimes.", "But you dont have that when you're coming out of foster care. You can't go back into foster care. You can't, you know, say okay, well, you know, I need a little help. I can't pay my rent. So I need to move back in with you. You know, so it's really hard.", "But I do want to say, one of  I think Jeremy said something about, you know, the state has taken custody, and, you know, they need to continue parenting beyond the age of 21. And I realize that doesn't necessarily mean residential. Like, you're not going to care for the people who have aged out by giving them a place to live, necessarily, but just, you know, some means of support and assistance and networking.", "But one benefit, I have to say, was that even after leaving foster care, I was able to always get federal aid as a student because I was a ward of the state. So I was able to get decent financial aid just by checking off that box that I was a ward of the state. So I was really  that was definitely a benefit.", "All right, Lacey, thanks very much, and good luck to you, too.", "Thank you.", "Bye-bye. This is obviously something that's available to the kids who do go to school. For those who don't, and you're talking about extended care from states, well, I think every state in the union is facing terrible, terrible budget crises at this time. It's not a propitious moment to ask for additional funding.", "No, it isn't, except there has been a change in federal law, which would allow states, starting this next year, to continue their foster care programs, have the same partnership with the federal government, get 50 to 75 cents on the dollar to operate that program. Very few states are doing that.", "I guess the argument I would make in favor of it is that we've heard now from a lot of young and not-so-young people who are in care, who have gone to college. And in many cases, the difference between making it or not, you can have financial aid, but if you don't have a place to live, you're not going to go to school. And so that's kind of part of that parenting role.", "But there's another whole group, large group, that are becoming a serious cost to society. They're ending up in jail. They're having children at a young age. They're losing custody of those children. So from a cost-benefit analysis, I think an argument could be made that not only is it the right thing morally to do because we aren't  I'm not going to abandon my children at 18. You've heard that from all the callers. But I think it's actually an economically wise thing for government to do.", "Here's an email from  it might be Meliss(ph) or M. Ellis(ph), I'm not so sure: I aged out in 1968. I'm a 60-year-old woman. I was completely on my own, attended college on my own with only loans, work. I made it, but at age 26, when I moved from Northern California, my home state, to Pocatello, Idaho, to take my first job as a teacher, I was basically rejected by the foster parents who I believed were my family.", "This devastated me, and for years, I dealt with depression. I became a teacher, later obtained a counseling license. I have a great family and marriage, two grown sons.", "I really needed, however, resources like those being given today and therapy from an early age. Thanks for attention to this group of children who are the bottom of the bottom. It has taken me a lifetime to address all the pain I experienced. I take great pride in being able to contribute to the counseling field. And I dont think there are many like me have made it very far. At least I haven't met one on the counseling field.", "I wonder, Jeremy, you're now basically in the counseling field.", "Not so much. I guess - I wouldnt necessarily (unintelligible) but I definitely do a lot of peer to peer work and definitely give them insight to the resources that are available that were also given to me at a young age that have been really the drive behind my success.", "What do you plan to do when you graduate?", "I plan to actually come here to D.C. because I got an internship with the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, which is big here in D.C. on promoting policy within the capital.", "So - but working on foster issues?", "Yes.", "So you're going to, in a sense, stay connected with the issues you've been connected with your whole life...", "Yes.", "...or your whole adult life anyway. And it's interesting, the number of people who called who said they were in foster care and are now counselors or social workers or something like that.", "Yeah. I think a lot of young people end up having social workers and counselor people who helped them and then they want to help. They want to give back.", "Or do what their surrogate father or mother did.", "Exactly. That's their role model, positive role model. The other thing I want to say is that the - a lot of the changes in policy in the last 10, 15 years are a function of people like Jeremy and the folks that have been calling in actually getting involved in policymaking. I think the best policy comes from listening to the voices of these young people and young adults, and theyve been enormously effective at affecting federal policy and state policy.", "Let's talk with Kevin, Kevin calling us from Davison, Michigan.", "Hi, Neal. Thanks for taking my call. I graduated, if you will, out of foster care at the age of 18 and I got a rough go. A lot of things that I didnt learn in the wonderful foster family that brought me in was, you know, how many wolves were waiting for me outside that door.", "Wolves like what?", "Well, my folks were killed when I was 16.", "Oh, I'm sorry.", "And, unfortunately, I inherited some money. It was enough to get me started, but not enough to get me through college or anything. And so I started my own business, thinking that's what I needed to do. And there were a lot wolves that I knew but didnt know that would do what they did. I did some mechanical work on a property. The property owner couldnt pay me so he sold the property and the people he sold the property to refused to pay me because I didnt put a mechanic's lien on it. So you know, things like that you learn real quick who you can and who you can't trust out there.", "It sounds like people took advantage of you.", "Absolutely. And, you know, I've learned - I'm now 44 and I had a wonderful foster family that were gracious enough to take me in - they didn't have to. And it was a rough road, but, you know, through perseverance and learning who you can and can't trust, you know, it helped me out.", "I wonder, do you have any connection with the foster system today?", "I do not, Neal. I was listening to the radio program and kind of feeling guilty about it. I've thought about it. I have raised a son. He's now 21 years old and graduating from the University of Michigan next year. And very proud. And I have the empty nest syndrome  bad. So maybe that's something I really need to look into.", "Well, good luck with that, Kevin, and thanks for the advice.", "Thanks, Neal.", "Bye-bye. Were talking about kids who age out of foster care. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "And let me reintroduce our guest, Jeremy Long, who is one of those kids, now about to graduate from Northern - the University of Northern Colorado and about to join us here in Washington, D.C. as a budding policymaker. And also with us, Mark Courtney, research and development director at Partners for Our Children at the University of Washington School of Social Work.", "And let's see if we got another caller on the line. Let's go to Mark(ph) and Mark's with us from Minneapolis.", "Hello.", "Hi, Mark.", "Hi, hi. I'm calling - I'm not a kid who aged out of foster care but I'm the parent of a kid who aged out of foster care. My son spent 11 years in the system and we actually met him after he'd aged out, and actually formally adopted him when he was in his early 20's, although we had been parenting for a period before that.", "What's the point of adopting someone in their early 20's?", "Well, I actually now worked with an agency that specializes with teenagers. We just - all we do is work with teens in the adoption system. We represent families in Minneapolis. And the point of it is that everybody does better if they have stable adults who are taking an interest in their lives and moving them forward. And in the case of our son, because of just the amount of disruptions he had experienced - I think he had 27 placements in 11 years.", "Wow.", "Oh, yeah. Fairly extraordinary. It really was helpful. It's been really helpful to have a family, to have parents who are helping you through school. He's in college now, really doing incredibly well and just thriving, living at home. And you know, I'm not sure that just because you're 20 or 18 that you're ready to not have a family. They still need a family.", "That's psychological buffer, knowing there's a place to go if you can't go anywhere else.", "That's exactly right. That's exactly right. And I think that when we talk about fixing the system, we so often just focus on, well, what are we going to do about kids who age out, and we forget that the first step should be: can we find families who can be there for these kids who are willing to step up, and whether they're 12 or five or 17, can we really take on that role of parenting?", "Mark, thank you very much.", "Thank you.", "It's an interesting situation. And Mark Courtney, that's good advice. But in the little time we have left, if there were a couple of changes that you think would make a difference, what would they be?", "Well, I think extending care. I mean, I do think that states should take up that option because it gives them a lot of resources to do it. And then, pay more attention to the fact that a one-size-fits-all solution isnt going to work. You got people like Jeremy who've gotten the right kind of help while they were in care, got the mental health services they need and can go to college to succeed. And then you've got a lot of young people who have suffered enormous trauma for a long period of time who are going to need help for a long period of time, substance abuse treatment, mental health treatment. Theyre going to need the kind of adults that Mark was talking about.", "Mm-hmm.", "And weve got a lot of parents. Half of the young people Im studying, young women, were parents by the age of 21. So if a state like Illinois is going to continue to help them, its going to be helping them with their parenting. So I think just being a lot more thoughtful about the fact that one size doesnt fit all.", "We do have a lot of success stories early on, and then we have some young people who are going to need a lot of help. And I think we need to find the adults to stick with them, and then we have to have the kinds of support, whether its housing, health insurance, educational support, that, you know, that we provide, that I'm going to provide my kids and the parents do these days.", "Thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate it. Mark Courtney at the University of School - Washington School of Social Work and the lead researcher on a new report from the University of Washington School of Social Work in Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago.

But Comey's already testified before Congress, as well. Like, he's been under oath. He's been asked these questions that have brought out some of these stories. So how much of this is really new?", "Well, the big-picture stuff, these kind of signposts along the way, we have heard about. But we do get some sort of vivid, new details on them - things that we didn't hear before. In one instance, Comey just describes a meeting that he had in the Oval Office in February of 2017 during which Trump asks Attorney General Jeff Sessions to leave the room.", "Right.", "And this is when Comey says that Trump asked him to let Michael Flynn, who was Trump's first national security adviser - to let him go.", "This was the whole, he's a good guy - yeah.", "Exactly. And he's talked about that before. But Comey's very critical of Sessions in the book. He describes him as both overwhelmed and overmatched by the job. And he recalls telling him that, you know, he can't be kicked out of the room so that the president can talk to Comey one on one. And he described Sessions' reaction to this. And he says Sessions cast his eyes down at the table, says they darted back and forth, side to side. He didn't respond. He said nothing. And he says Sessions' posture said he wouldn't be able to help at all.", "Huh. Interesting. I mean, it has to be said this is self-serving in some ways, isn't it? I mean, Comey has been attacked from all sides over, as you mentioned, how he handled the Hillary Clinton email scandal. This is about making sure that he secures his own legacy the way he wants to.", "Well, he certainly wants to have his view of what transpired on the record and have people know that this is what he says happened. But, you know, this isn't going to change a lot of views out there in many ways. Views are already so entrenched. You have people who dislike the president who are going to take this as ammunition to bolster their views. And people who feel that Comey is a disgraced, vengeful former FBI director are going to say that there's nothing to see here.", "I also said at the beginning that the RNC had already waged a pre-emptive strike in response.", "Yeah.", "We should just note they've secured a website called lyincomey.com.", "Exactly.", "All right. More, to be sure, in coming days. NPR's Ryan Lucas - thanks so much, Ryan.", "Thank you.", "All right. Remember the TPP? Remember how much President Trump hated this thing? He might be changing his mind.", "Yeah. Yesterday, lawmakers from farm states visited the White House, and they told the president they were worried about how his threat to impose tariffs might hit the agricultural industry. After the meeting, Senator Ben Sasse talked to reporters.", "Definitely, the big headline coming out of this meeting is that the president said he was deputizing Larry Kudlow and Ambassador Lighthizer to look at re-entering the TPP negotiations.", "He is referring to the president's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. They're apparently going to be looking into rejoining a major trade deal that President Trump pulled the U.S. out of.", "Yeah, right - the old TPP. All right. NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley is with us. Hey, Scott.", "Good morning, Rachel.", "I know you love talking about the TPP.", "(Laughter).", "So talk about it. Remind us what this thing is.", "This is a trade agreement that the Obama administration spent years negotiating with 11 other countries around the Pacific Rim. China is not part of it, but a lot of other fast-growing economies are. Had the U.S. joined, I think it would have covered something like 40 percent of the world's economy. It would have opened up markets to U.S. products, including farm goods, which is why those farm state politicians are interested in this issue.", "Right.", "It also would have included some intellectual property protections and created kind of a united front for the intellectual property battle the U.S. is now waging with China.", "And why didn't President Trump like it?", "Well, the president is suspicious of trade deals generally and especially big, multilateral agreements like this one. He has waged similar criticisms of NAFTA. He says that the United States gets the short end of the stick in these agreements. And one of his first actions as president was to withdraw the U.S. from the TPP.", "So what has changed? I mean, is China - it's the tariffs all of a sudden. Now he's like, oh. This may have been a good thing - for us to have joined.", "(Laughter) I don't think very much has really changed, except with those other 11 countries. They have proceeded and created a deal of their own without the United States. They say they would be happy to have the United States rejoin the talks, but they're not willing to let Donald Trump or his negotiators dictate the terms on which that agreement would be struck. So it's a little bit like the Paris climate accord, where Trump also announced plans to pull the U.S. out but said, hey, we might be willing to get back in if we could dictate the terms that were more favorable to the United States. And the rest of the world essentially moved on, leaving the U.S...", "Right.", "...On the sidelines rather than in a position of leadership.", "Well, so what happens now? I mean, is it even possible for the U.S. to get into this agreement again?", "It is possible. It's certainly possible. But I don't think it's very likely. And evidently, what happened here was the president told the people in the room at the time what they wanted to hear. And then within 12 hours, Trump himself popped this trial balloon. You have to remember that not only did Donald Trump campaign against this trade agreement, but Hillary Clinton campaigned against this trade agreement. And while these farm state lawmakers are very supportive of the TPP, there's also a lot of opposition in Congress. There's a lot of opposition in the American public. And there's especially a lot of opposition among Trump's base. So I wouldn't hold my breath for any renegotiated TPP with the U.S. as a player.", "NPR's Scott Horsley for us this morning. Thanks so much, Scott.", "You're very welcome.", "All right. The White House says there is still no final decision about potential military action in Syria.", "Although the president did meet yesterday with his national security team to talk about responses to a suspected chemical attack on a rebel-held town in Syria. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis walked back some of this talk of an imminent strike. He told the House armed services committee that there's a need to, quote, \"keep this from escalating out of control.\"", "NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre is in the studio with us this morning. Hey, Greg.", "Hi. Good morning, Rachel.", "So we've got Mattis trying to lower the temperature, at least on the rhetoric, about an imminent strike. Does that mean it's not going to happen, or at least it's not as imminent as we thought?", "I would say not as imminent. No final decision is what we're hearing from the White House. He clearly wants to be cautious about this and wants to make it about, it would seem, the chemical weapons attack and not broaden out and to make the U.S. play a larger role in this civil war in Syria. So he does have his concern. He wants the French and the British on board, and it seems they are, if indeed attack does go forward. So that's what he's looking for - is a little more planning here before anything happens.", "Which is interesting because we've spoken on this program with a former U.S. ambassador to Syria, Robert Ford, who said these one-off strikes don't work. I mean, the Trump administration already struck Assad over a previous chemical weapons attack, and it didn't prevent him from doing it again. So there are some calls for a more sustained military action. You're saying Mattis doesn't have an appetite for that.", "Apparently not. But again, you're absolutely right. Exactly a year ago, there was this response to a chemical weapons attack. Now we see another one. And Assad's position is much stronger right now. He's gaining more territory, consolidating territory. So not only has he not taken the lesson from the previous strike, but he's in a stronger position.", "How could it escalate?", "I - the Russians are embedded in a lot of places there. If a strike hit some - killed some Russians, damaged Russian planes - that sort of thing - that could make Russia want to respond. They're already threatening to shoot down the missiles - that sort of thing. So that would be a way that the Russians could be drawn in. Again, I think the Syrians and the Russians don't want to escalate, but that is always a danger.", "Meanwhile, there's no one leading the State Department right now. Mike Pompeo, CIA director, is in flux. He had his confirmation hearing yesterday, where he tried to push back on being labeled as someone who was necessarily a hardliner on all issues, including Syria.", "He did. He frustrated a lot of the Democrats, who said, you have this long record of very hawkish statements. So we'd like to hear more. But he will probably make the State Department more important to play a larger role than his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. He has Trump's ear. We can expect him to play a loud - a very vocal role. And we have a new national security adviser, John Bolton, this week. So a new team is coming in at a very critical moment.", "All right.

Journalist and blogger Scott Kirsner discusses the ethical choice bloggers have to make in his op-ed that appeared in Sunday's San Jose Mercury News.", "utt": ["Right now, the TALK OF THE NATION Opinion Page. Microsoft raised eyebrows in December when it offered free laptops to some of the bloggers who review its software, and it wasn't the first time marketers approached blogs like this. Reporters, of course, generally follow the ethics rules of their publications and would never accept a freebie. But what about bloggers?", "Many of them want nothing to do with the mainstream media and pointedly make clear they are not journalists. In an op-ed in Sunday's San Jose Mercury News, Scott Kirsner, both a blogger and a journalist himself, argues that bloggers have a choice to make: be a source of information that their readers can trust or just an online version of an infomercial. And he says whatever their decision, blogs need to come clean with their readers.", "Scott Kirsner edits the blog CinemaTech. He's the author of the book \"The Future of Web Video,\" and he joins us now from the studios of member station KALW in San Francisco, and nice to have you back on the program today.", "It's great to be here.", "And we want to invite listeners to the conversation. If you rely on blogs for some of your news or reviews of equipment, would it bother you if those bloggers accepted free gifts from the companies or the people they cover? How do you decide which blogs you can trust and which you can't? 800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr.org. And Scott, some of the bloggers did accept free laptops from Microsoft, and some of them also disclosed that on their blogs.", "Yeah, it's true. I mean, one of the points that I make in my piece is that actually I think bloggers are having a much more open conversation with their readers than the traditional news media have ever had in terms of what are the rules of the game here? Are you allowed to accept a laptop worth about $2,000? Can you, if you're a blogger who covers restaurants, can you accept a free meal from a restaurant that wants promotion? Or maybe if you're a political blogger, what are the rules about volunteering for a campaign or making campaign donations?", "All those rules have been developed in radio and TV and print media over about 100 years. They've always kind of been a little bit of a secret. You know, there's an ethics policy that journalists have to sign when they work for a newspaper or a magazine. In the world of the blogosphere, though, what's fascinating is that these debates and discussions are happening out in the open, in the comment space on lots of blogs, including the ones that accepted free laptops from Microsoft last month.", "And does it turn out that the readers of blogs care about this?", "Well, I think there is definitely a division. With the Microsoft issue, some readers said no, you know, I understand that you're just an individual who publishes this blog about technology. It's okay with me if you take a free laptop. I would do the same thing. And in a way it almost kind of ratified the importance of these bloggers, that Microsoft thought they were influential enough to give them a free laptop.", "But there were some comments on a few of the blogs that said, you know, yeah, I feel like you've sold out. I feel like your credibility is gone. Whenever you write about Microsoft now, I'm going to remember the fact that they sent you this free laptop with their new Vista operating system on it, and I'm going to kind of, you know, look askance at anything positive that you might say about Microsoft in the future.", "And has anybody - have any of these bloggers had a, you know, note - you know, this blog typed on a free laptop from Microsoft?", "Well, you know, most of them were very straightforward about it, but you kind of got a little bit of this momentum effect, where once a few -there were about I think 100 bloggers that got this free laptop in December, right around Christmastime, appropriately enough; and once a few of them started to disclose it, others felt like they needed to disclose it, too.", "So it almost was this, you know, this mob mentality of, you know, if you're someone who got the free laptop, you suddenly felt like, oh gee, I'd better disclose this because other people are starting to talk about it too.", "You know, and you could view that as a positive thing, that most of these bloggers do disclose it. A lot of them, though, said I'm keeping it. A few of them said no, I'm going to send it back. And I think there was a third group that actually said I'm going to give it away on my blog, you know, as kind of a promotion for my blog, and that might have some ethical issues around it, too, you know, getting a free laptop from Microsoft and then using it to sort of help build the readership of your blog.", "We're talking with Scott Kirsner about bloggers and ethics. His op-ed ran yesterday in the San Jose Mercury News. We have a link to the op-ed at our Web site. You can download all of the recent Opinion Page podcasts at npr.org/talk. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "And I found one of the most interesting things in your op-ed, Scott, was the statement that, you know, if you are influential - and there are plenty of blogs who are influential - if you are influential, they are going to try to influence you.", "Yeah, I really do think that within the last year or two, we've really started to see marketers and P.R. people realize that these blogs have very big readerships, and just like they send free products or party invitations or other promotional material to journalists and people in TV and people in radio, they really need to focus on these bloggers too.", "And you've even got big P.R. firms starting up divisions specifically to focus on bloggers. And you mentioned that I maintain a blog that kind of focuses on the entertainment industry. I definitely do get all kinds of press releases now and occasionally invitations to things, and I think I'm working through these issues too, in terms of trying to be careful about if I've gone to a conference at the invitation of a company, mentioning that, you know, that I'm here with a free ticket.", "Yeah, if - yeah, there are all kinds of rules about do you accept a fee for speaking to a company who you cover.", "Yeah, I mean, we did see - it wasn't mentioned in the op-ed piece I ran yesterday, but Maria Bartiromo too, being the focal point of, you know, an ethics quandary about should she have been flying around on Citigroup's jet for free when Citigroup is obviously a company that she covers.", "I don't believe that journalists are pure and live in glass houses and never violate ethics rules. Obviously, I think both journalists and bloggers can kind of fall into a trap of, you know, assuming that the reader will trust them no matter what they do, when you really - you know, the best thing is probably to disclose where you have some financial ties or you might be swayed by something that you got for free.", "Let's get a caller on the line. This is Daniel, Daniel with us from Spearfish in South Dakota.", "Yes. I am a blogger and podcaster for the San Francisco company PodShow, and I realize that although I have a distinct advantage in terms of marketing and promotion, many bloggers do not, nor do they have training as media or journalist professionals.", "However, it is in - anybody who interacts with the public in a mass-media forum has a responsibility for full disclosure as to where their money comes from or any type of kick-back comes from, but it's also in their best interest as a media producer to have full disclosure. I think that blogs, once trust is lost - trust is essential for any type of new media communications tool, and once readers lose trust, it does not behoove the blogger to hide or not give full disclosure on any type of financial gain they may have.", "Yeah, and Scott Kirsner, as you point out, these rules have been developed over many years for the mainstream media, who have editors, and this history, this, you know, precedence to go back (unintelligible), and most bloggers are individuals.", "Right, and they don't have an ombudsman looking over their shoulders, as many newspapers and broadcast media have. I don't think that a blogger needs to write a 10-page ethics policy. I think they just need to think about hey, this is a conversation between me and the reader that I'm having, and what sorts of things would I disclose in a conversation with a friend?", "If I am making a stock tip to a friend and saying, oh, I believe that Acme Corp is a great company, and the stock's definitely going to go up 10 points, I would probably also say, yeah, I happen to own some stock in Acme Company. I wouldn't hide that fact.", "So I think thinking about blogging as a conversation, and what would you reveal if you were talking to a friend is probably a good starting point.", "Daniel, thanks very much.", "Thank you very much.", "And the other point that you make is that the Internet itself is sort of a corrective feedback mechanism.", "Yeah, and bloggers really do call each other out, just like they call the mainstream media out when they perceive that there's an ethical lapse or, you know, a hazy line between advertising and editorial in the mainstream media. You know, bloggers really do like to be the first to disclose something, and sometimes that which they're disclosing is so-and-so was at this dinner party and went home with a bag of freebies from the company.", "You know, I do think, as the caller kind of brought up, that blogging is a really new medium, and we've had decades or in some cases longer to develop a relationship with a newspaper and kind of understand, okay, this newspaper or this TV station has a certain reputation. Bloggers don't have that length of time to develop their reputations.", "Scott Kirsner, thanks very much for being with us today.", "Thanks for having me.", "Scott Kirsner edits the blog CinemaTech.

Welcome.", "Hey, Ailsa. Thanks for having me.", "Thank you for making the time. So if you had gotten a meeting with President Trump today, tell me what you would've said to him.", "Well, the first message is, be not afraid. This is a mainstream issue right now. All of America is looking for - practically all of America is looking for common sense gun safety reform, whether it be background checks, whether it be assault weapons. So the people are behind you. And these are not radical ideas in terms of gun safety. What's radical is that nothing is being done right now.", "So it's a time in our history where - when a statesperson steps up and does something, they will be remembered forever for changing this tide. Americans, Louisvillians, are just tired. You know, when you think you can go to a shopping center...", "Well, let me ask you, though...", "...To a ballgame and you're worried about being gunned down - and unfortunately, we know it's going to happen in another city sometime soon. So something has to be done. A leader must step up.", "On what can be done - I read your letter - you advocate for expanding background checks, passing red flag laws, a ban on assault weapons and on high-capacity magazines. I just want to get real with you. Do you actually see a Republican-led Senate passing all of that, even an assault weapons ban?", "It's possible. Look. As I said, these aren't radical ideas. And not only is this the platform of the United States Conference of Mayors, it's also the platform of the Major Cities Police Chiefs. So think about this. This is law enforcement saying this. This is the people that are closest to their citizens - the mayors - saying this is what your citizens are demanding. So if people can abandon this as a partisan issue and embrace it as a human issue, as an American issue, to say, this is so far out of whack that this is not normal.", "This morning, I talked to a grandma that said - she said, I'm thinking about buying my granddaughter a bulletproof backpack that comes with a bulletproof vest. I didn't even know those things existed. They shouldn't exist. This is where we've gotten to as a country right now. And I would just hope anybody that's elected would say this has gone too far. This is not a party issue. We've got to get on the same page here.", "Now, we've seen President Trump appear receptive to expanding background checks in the past, but we've also seen him step that back. Do you see an opening with this president this time around that maybe you didn't see in the past?", "I think we have to keep calling the question. When you remember Sandy Hook, it was never again. Dayton now is do something. The president sees that, and I believe he knows this is the right thing to do. Advocates that are, you know, high-paid lobbyists somehow seem to overwhelm the voice of the American people. So I think this is a moment where a true statesperson will look over that and say enough is enough. This is what we're going to do.", "And it can't just stop with background checks. I mean, the minimum thing is for the president to give the green light to the Senate - for Senator Mitch McConnell to call the vote so people can be accounted for. Young people are coming out like never before. We saw a great program put out by our young leaders in Parkland today. Young people are going to be voting on this issue as well.", "But you do seem to think that this time feels different. Do you feel like we've reached a tipping point?", "It has to. Moms are not going away. Students aren't going away. Mayors aren't going away. This issue needs to stay front and center. It's not just the mass shootings that make the headlines. It's the daily drumbeat of deaths that we see in our country - suicide by gun.", "Now, let me ask you - your letter mainly focused on what lawmakers in Washington can do, what the president can do. But I'm wondering, you know, because you mentioned Louisville itself is seeing a spike in gun violence right now, what can mayors do about gun safety?", "Well, believe it or not, there's common sense things that just don't happen all the time. Some of these weapons that we're finding that are involved with local shootings have been stolen from people that leave their cars open. So imagine that - somebody has a gun, they leave it on the front seat of their car, and then it's gone and then used in a crime. Kentucky, unfortunately, has very loose gun safety laws here. So we are preempted from the state from doing anything, but we can certainly...", "Right. I understand state law bars any local action on guns. So what can you do as mayor?", "Well, as I said, encourage people to practice safe gun practices. Lock your car. You shouldn't even have a gun in your car. Lock your gun up at home. How many times have we heard about the young boy or girl that's taken their life because of a gun being out there? Use gun locks. These are just super-common-sense things.", "As we move forward, though, and as you see President Trump continue to backtrack on his comments on background checks, in the last 30 seconds we have, what would you like to tell him to stay on the message that you would like him to stay on?", "Listen to the American people. We're a democracy. That's what we're supposed to be doing. There can be special interests that are whispering in his ear. They represent the past. What the future is are the kids in our elementary schools or high schools that practice a mass shooting drill during the first couple days of school.

It was sort of, you know, round hole - yeah, literally that, like a campfire. But it did have all the string on, which was pretty useful.", "(Singing) I got all livestock. I got all livestock. I got all livestock. And the man say, well, you're all right boy; just get on through. You don't have to pay me nothing.", "And there was this sort of explosion of music in the '50s. And what we had over in England was this guy Lonnie Donegan. The song I'm going to sort of give as an illustration of this is \"Rock Island Line.\"", "(Singing) I got pig iron. I got pig iron. I got all pig iron. Now, I'll tell you where I'm going, Boy - down the Rock Island Line. She's a mighty good road.", "I mean, he was superb. It was absolutely superb. But there he was, playing, like, an acoustic guitar. Sort of every Saturday there would be a show on the television where usually he was on every other week, and it was just something to behold at the time, just his whole passion and the way that he deliver this material.", "Now, the thing is that he'd been in a jazz band prior to that, and he really understood all of this sort of blues, American country, blues and all of that. By the time you get to the end of this, he's really spitting it out - \"Rock Island Line.\" It's fantastic stuff.", "(Singing) Down the Rock Island Line - she's a mighty good road. The Rock Island Line is the road to ride. Yeah, the Rock Island Line - she's a mighty good road. But if you want to ride, you got to ride it like you find it. Get your ticket at the station of the Rock Island Line.", "So this guitar was there, and then somebody showed me how to tune it up - somebody at school. Then I started strumming away like - not (unintelligible) but having a go, just sort of strumming chords and all of that stuff. You'll find so many of the guitarists from the '60s will all say Lonnie Donegan was the influence. So here you go. Have a listen.", "(Singing) The Rock Island Line - she's a mighty good road. And if you want to ride, you got to ride it like you find it. Get your ticket at the station of the Rock Island Line.", "That's Jimmy Page of the band Led Zeppelin. He was talking with NPR's Bob Boilen about the song that changed his life, Lonnie Donegan's recording of \"Rock Island Line.\"", "(Singing) The Rock Island Line - she's a mighty good road. And if you want to ride, you got to ride it like you find it.

But over this week, NATO has intensified bombings, day and night, in Tripoli, the country's capital and at Moammar Gadhafi's stronghold.

He joins us from the campus in Hanover, New Hampshire. Professor Vandewalle, thanks for being with us.", "My pleasure.", "It's a stalemate?", "I think it is indeed a stalemate. It is quite clear that the rebels themselves in the eastern part of Libya simply don't have the capability of really conquering the rest of the country. And so the stalemate is even more acute in part because the international coalition that is NATO in effect has become now the arbiter of whether or not it remains a stalemate or whether or not Gadhafi gets deposed.", "What about the initial premise to protect civilians? Has that been met?", "It has of course been met to a certain extent but the problem has been that, remember, at the very beginning that President Obama warned us against mission creep and that is exactly what has happened. Because it's gone far beyond simply protecting individuals. It's now actively targeting Gadhafi and the people around him.", "And in effect what NATO is now trying to accomplish is what we would call a regime change, for all practical purposes.", "Is it beyond the realm of possibility now to you that regime change might occur in the next few weeks or months?", "I think regime change is inevitable in Libya. The resources that the Gadhafi government has at this particular point in time are steadily being degraded and being degraded at rapidly almost an exponential rate I would argue. But also the ability to feed the population in Tripoli (unintelligible), and particularly in Tripoli access to money to pay for the resources that he needs.", "And so in the end, I think, the removal of the Gadhafi regime is inevitable at this point.", "Yet, back in March you were on with our colleagues on WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY when the plan to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya was initiated. You said it created more problems than it solved. How do you feel about that now?", "In a sense I still feel the same way. The only positive development that we've seen so far is that the rebel, the transitional government in Benghazi has been able to organize itself a bit better, and is trying to build an infrastructure. But in a sense the very basic problem remains that NATO now needs to act more forcefully to remove Gadhafi.", "When you bomb a man's house or perhaps it should be palace, do you kind of close of any possibility that he'll decide to go into exile and obviate the military campaign?", "It certainly, I think, makes it much more difficult. And in a way that scenario that even the United States was interested in, let's say, about a month and a half ago, has frankly, I think, disappeared. First of all, the international criminal court has indicted Gadhafi, his son and a couple of people around Gadhafi. So that means effectively that he has very, very few places that he can go.", "And then also the intensification of the bombing has really brought home the message that Gadhafi has kept repeating since this uprising started, that this is a kind of a Western-orchestrated attempt to get at Libya's oil, to occupy Libya again. And so in a sense for Gadhafi this has become a self-fulfilling prophecy and by all indications Gadhafi and probably his family around him are indeed not showing of any signs of wanting to leave Libya.", "And as Gadhafi himself put it, he wants to become the kind of martyr that kind of resonates with the anti-West rhetoric that we've heard from the regime all the way going back to 1969.", "And to be blunt about it, do you foresee him getting his wish in a few months?", "I do, unless something really unexpected happens. I think, as he expressed again over the last couple of days, that he is the personification of Libya as a nation, therefore he himself, I think, will likely not leave Libya.", "Dirk Vandewalle, a professor of government at Dartmouth College.

So what are Democrats saying on the Hill as they are digesting this report? And we should say - right - we're talking a couple hundred pages, so people are theoretically still reading.", "Yes. And we are getting a lot of statements from people saying that they are still reading and that they may be withholding judgment about some parts of this. But a lot of the reaction from Democrats is more or less what we would expect. They say they have evidence and reason to keep investigating President Trump and his associates. And they say this report really bolsters that.", "One notable trend is that they are really focusing on whether or not Attorney General Barr misled them with his original characterization of the Mueller report. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler was explicit about this in a press conference in New York.", "Attorney General Barr appears to have shown an unsettling willingness to undermine his own department in order to protect President Trump. Barr's words and actions suggest he has been disingenuous and misleading in saying the president is clear of wrongdoing.", "Now, he is not alone in this either. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, released a joint statement where they said the differences are stark between what Attorney General Barr said on obstruction and what special counsel Mueller said on obstruction. And they said that as they continue to review the report that they believe that Barr presented a conclusion that did not represent what Mueller found. And they're giving a really strong impression that they're going to take a hard-line tack.", "But again, they're not talking about impeachment. They're not talking about specific steps. So it's really not clear yet how this is going to manifest.", "Republicans were largely pleased with the summary that the attorney general released a few weeks ago. I assume that the report didn't really change much of that for them today.", "Right. And they also fall into this two camps of saying - some people saying that they are still reading it and then a group of people who are responding in the way that we would expect from Republicans. The ones who are speaking up are defending the president. There - some are saying that he's been fully vindicated.", "And they focus primarily on the question of whether or not there was collusion with the Russians. Take Steve Scalise, who's the Republican whip in the House. He says Democrats owe the American people an apology. He says there was no collusion and no obstruction and referred to what Democrats have done over the past couple years as a smear campaign.", "We also heard from Kevin McCarthy, who's Republican leader in the House. And he says nothing has - changes, that this is exactly what they had expected out of the Mueller report for the past 22 months.", "Just to go back to something we heard a little bit from the senator earlier. I mean, Democrats have been very focused on the question of obstruction by the president. And as we've been talking about, Mueller doesn't offer an official judgment on the report, leaves it to Congress to come to its conclusion. What does this mean for Democrats, particularly in the House, if they are, as you're saying, hinting that they're not talking about impeachment in as strong terms?", "Right. Yeah. This is the kind of fodder Democrats really did need to move forward. They needed to be able to point to some sort of evidence that says, yes, there are unfounded or undecided parts of this. And it specifically says investigators wanted to preserve and maintain evidence and - for testimony in future prosecution or congressional action, and that sets up those next steps.", "How likely are they to get that information?", "That part is yet to be seen. They really are going to keep pushing for that. And we've already heard some talk of subpoenas or other ways that they could go about getting the information. We do know that they want Attorney General Barr to come testify. He'll be in front of Congress in May. And they're asking for Mueller to appear before the end of May.

And that Republicans have a representative of Donald Trump to me has just been sad, to use a phrase Donald Trump likes. I've felt that this was almost inevitable, that Donald Trump would force a separation between himself and the party. You know, Republican leaders that I know, for the most part, even those that are still supporting Donald Trump because of a binary choice, are not like Donald Trump. They believe in attempting to govern. They don't believe in his sort of tactics. They're sort of appalled by him. So I - it's...", "...Let's talk a little - it sounds like you're still trying to make sense of this and really what it means moving forward because it is a delicate line, right?

And I can't imagine those pressures. You know, clearly the best thing would be for Donald Trump to step aside. As you said in your earlier report, there are provisions then that he could be replaced. That would be the best for a national discussion about real issues.", "Although you know he has said that's never going to happen.", "That's true. I have no idea what Donald Trump will or won't do, but I can only speak to what would be best. And I would argue that would be best for Donald Trump and his long-term image or career of businessman because the next 30 days or, you know, 28 days here are going to be not pretty for Donald Trump. He has said a lot of things and done a lot of things which the public has not been exposed to yet, and the odds that they will come out and then - between now and the election are pretty great. These conversations, you don't sit on a bus like that and talk like that, you know, the only time you've done it. And he's been around a lot of microphones and been on a lot of TV sets and people are rolling tape. You know, one of the most amazing things about this is that he said this to Billy Bush when he knew he was mic'd. This wasn't captured by somebody by chance.", "As you see this increasing schism - I mean, as someone who's been calling for the party to reinvent itself, do you see a kind of utility in this moment? I mean, is there an opportunity here as someone who's looking down the pike, trying to look at the future of the GOP?", "You know, I - that's a great question. And I have no idea. You know, after 2012, the party went through this process, so-called autopsy, which I think Reince Priebus deserves a lot of credit for. And now the party's turned 180 degrees from that. I mean, everything that was recommended as far as outreach and becoming a party that must confront the fact that we have to get to be a national governing party, more non-white support. And now the party's done the exact opposite. So I really don't know the degree to which parties are learning organisms.", "We'll have to leave it there.

And their explicit goal is to get interest rates lower than they would be otherwise, so that mortgage rates can be lower, so that more people can buy houses.", "The reason the investment banker thought he might go to jail is because it's like a company buying its own stock at a crucial moment just to artificially increase the price so that they can make more profit.", "It means the Fed is running a pump and dump scandal here?", "I don't - I'm not saying that at all.", "They're fairly open about the whole thing.

This requires trillions of dollars of government support.", "Now, for many years mortgage rates have been lower because China and other foreign governments have bought huge amounts of U.S. debt. Are they still doing that, and should we worry that perhaps they might stop?", "Yeah, this is certainly on everyone's mind these days. They've been buying U.S. government debt forever, and U.S. government debt has gotten less and less attractive to them because it's been paying lower and lower interest rates. But we are not there yet. We are not at the falling over a cliff place. China is still buying a very healthy amount of U.S. government debt and so are many other foreign governments.", "But we are hearing signs. We are beginning to see the early stages of them saying, hey, maybe we're going to diversify. Maybe we're going to move to other assets. And what we hope very much, we should, I mean, I think everyone in the world would benefit if that happens in a slow and measured way and not in an abrupt way. I don't think it's in China's interest to just send the U.S. economy on some horrible downward slide. So hopefully that will happen in a measured pace.", "Is anybody authoritative offering some measure of how far along the road toward recovery we can now say the economy is?", "I'd said it's notable that they're not screaming out how wonderful this news is today. I think this may turn out to be the first tentative steps towards a healing of this economic crisis. But that's the very best case scenario that it's the first tentative steps. I think that there's an awful lot that has to happen before our banks are fundamentally healthy, our credit markets are fundamentally healthy and people in businesses are able to get the money they want to borrow so that they can start the economy being, you know, in its own self-sustaining way, productive again.

But there are a lot of people who are crying foul, suggesting that this seven to 10 day notice before demolition will occur is unfair because the way the notice will happen is the city will publish an advertisement over three days in the local newspaper there, listing the addresses affected.

You can go back over the years and read every single report evaluating the agency. It's always been under-resourced. It doesn't handle complaints when they're supposed to, on a timely basis. So it's nice for them to have an ad campaign, but the housing part of HUD hasn't done its job in trying to help people in a way that housing would be made available. And the enforcement part, I just think that the ad campaign is nice, but it is window dressing.", "But on balance, I think that the judge's order down in New Orleans is probably the best way we can go at this time and try to notify people, because the property needs to be cleaned up. Those areas, there are many places where there is wood and bricks and everything else out in the street, and obstructions, and that's got to be cleared away before we can do something else.", "Bob Meadows, it must be difficult though, if you're an evacuee, and you see the structure that is not just a structure to you, but your home, and knowing that emotionally you believe and hope that you'll be able to save it. But as Mary suggests that possibly it is the emotion in your heart thinking more than your need.", "Certainly, it is. And that was one of the things that people were arguing for and asking for them to delay, or at least try and give notice, is that so people would at least be able to try and get home, try and come back and at least go through, because one of the things we have to remember is that we're not necessarily talking about physical structures that are standing.", "Mm hmm.", "A lot of these places, as Dr. Berry implied, these places are rubble, rubbish, just refuse left over, but they do want people to at least be able to come home and perhaps go through it and see if they can find anything that means something to them. But, as we also said, this is the Lower Ninth Ward that they're starting at. A lot of these people were people who had to be evacuated and, therefore, are scattered around the country. Seven to 10 days? Not likely they're going to be able to get home in time.", "Mm hmm.", "You know, one of the most…", "Sorry.", "Let me ask you this, John, and then pick up on that point. Mary raised an interesting question and I thought it was interesting to hear, when I asked the secretary about the idea of HUD and their thoughts of what had been going on and his suggestion that that is more a regional than a local issue, but knowing that, they may in fact have to come in on the backend and provide housing.", "There still seems to be the idea of, this whole situation, this whole region, this whole area, of being too much of a hot potato for anyone to want to hold.", ": Yes, there is a problem. I mean, nationally, in terms of what the people we're talking about have had to go through, these are people who, you know, don't have apartments. And in terms of the trailers, there's this not in my backyard issue as to where the trailers are going to be. People are being kicked out of their hotels.", "And it seems to me we definitely have a situation where the local organizations are going to have to do most of the work. And the exciting thing is that there are community advocates for these people, such as Tracy Washington and Bill Quigley. And it seems to me that in terms of looking ahead, I really agree with what Mayor Nagin said about the chocolate city and I eagerly anticipate it. And so with all sensitivities taken care of, I want to see these houses raised so that we can build a functioning chocolate city and show that there can be such a thing that is not a pit of destruction.", "Washington, D.C., will tell you it's chocolate city two.", "And chocolate city, chocolate city, by the way, Nagin had used it in speeches before. And as listeners might know, I'm now a great defender of his. And before, what he didn't understand is after what happened down there and these issues now, he couldn't just say something like that and have it taken in the same way. He should be more careful about what he says. But I realize the stress that he's under.", "All right. Let's turn our attention to something that's very interesting, quite frankly, and that is, surprise, surprise, that we are now seeing Democrats and Republicans vying for the first to be true in talking about the idea of truly reforming lobbying in Washington. We had on this week, two African American lobbyists who clearly want it known that by virtue of their prism, they believe lobbying is doing just fine and there are only just a few rotten apples in the bunch, but now Democrats are suggesting that you ban all gifts and travel paid for by lobbyists. They're aiming to seize this issue, obviously, as people take a close look at this. Republicans counter with a 24-page document targeting Democrats as being hypocritical and the hypocrisy, quite frankly, is flying on both ends here.", "How realistic, John McWhorter, is it to be believed that we are going to see any kind of real reform when it comes to lobbying in Washington when you know the kinds of dollars that fly in the nation's capital?", "Oh, well, please. I mean, we can chase an ideal, but this doesn't get to the heart of it which is the influence that special interests always have and I think always will have on legislation. That's the way the Republic has always operated, for better or for worse. And it does bear mentioning that I think that in the case that something is being lobbied for that is considered a good thing by what you might call the blue state crowd, somehow I think we're a little bit less indignant, sometimes a little bit of lobbying can be a good thing.", "Obviously, the Abramoff scandal is the bad kind of lobbying. This is too flagrant and too sleazy. But we're not going to really change anything. Don't we see something like this happening every, about every 20 years? This is just the latest episode.", "Well, Mary, I was going to bring that up and I'm curious what you think about this Democratic plan, as I suggested, would try to curb all of these perks, if you will, barring lobbyists from giving gifts to members of Congress. The Republican plan, like this one, said they want to end fact finding trips, that's where these trips are paid for by often lobbyists...", "Well, it's where you go play golf in Scotland.", "...and deemed as fact finding. But you do all of these wonderful things in lieu of finding fact.", "Right, absolutely.", "They also want in-dead-of-night insertions of special interest legislation and we should note that that is the pork barrel spending that is added on to bills that most people wouldn't blink an eye at and it's usually done “late at night\" and in hopes that people won't realize it. This has been going on for years and years and years. Mary, this has been talked about, reform has been talked about, nothing happens.", "Absolutely, absolutely. And both sides have done it. The problem now is that what Delay and the crowd did was over-the-top. I mean, and they were so open about it, this K Street Project. I mean, saying publicly, you know, you guys, I know some people who run lobby firms here and they tell me, we were told you better hire so many Republicans if you don't hire them by whatever, don't, you know, come in here and they better be these people. And so it was sort of over-the-top and there's nothing wrong with lobbying.", "What's wrong is the money, the influence, the payoffs and all the rest of it, that have been going on. I think the legislation should be passed. I think the Democratic legislation is a little bit stronger, and it should be passed. And if you wonder why it's not as much of a political problem for the Democrats is because, you know, Willie Sutton robbed banks because that's where the money was. The Republicans got most of the money because they're the ones who have the power. They're the ones who control all three branches of the government.", "But the problem is whether or not the reforms when they're passed, and something will pass before the election, whether they will be enforced on the Hill and they're not because the House Ethics Committee doesn't even work now. It hasn't even met and it isn't even doing anything. And in fact, Abramoff would not be known about publicly as this guy who was crooked if some reporter hadn't done a big series in The Washington Post and then that forced the Justice Department to go out and take a look at him.", "So this is all happenstance that is happening. Yes, it should be passed. Also bottom line, if we don't do something about campaign finance and the money that's paid for campaigns, all that will happen is the money that's going now for the lobbyists, the lobbyists will give the money to the campaigns and then they'll get the same result.", "Bob Meadows, let me ask you this: Is it smart for Democrats to use this as a campaign issue when, as Mary and John both noted, that this does happen on both sides of the isle. Can this come back to bite you?", "Sort of like Ted Kennedy challenging Alito's membership and then finding out that he had his own. It is the pot calling the kettle black as they say, but you know, I thought it was interesting that Barack Obama, who's new to the Senate said that, you know, Republicans have suddenly found religion. But I think it's actually everyone finds religion on this and John said every 20 years.", "I think it's every two years because that's how often the elections come up. This is something that the Democrats want to grab onto and hope that they can ride. They have a 12 year losing streak in Congress right now. They want to grab onto to this and hopefully ride it into more seats in both Houses.", "But let's not forget though, it is an important issue. Even though we're talking the inside baseball on it. It is a very important and serious issue that money can influence us directly and if you've got a whole big pile of money, you can influence what projects get approved and get earmarks and do all this kinds of stuff. Whatever party is doing it.", "It's the money.", "And right now, the Republicans have the problem because they get most of the money and they have most of the ties with most of the guys who turned out to be crooked. So in that sense, it is a good political issue.", "So, John, Should we believe that that will not change today and that we will see a lobbying effort against this, money being thrown toward this, and we're going to see a watered down reform package?", "It seems to me at that this point, I think as we're all concurring here, there's certain gestures going on that are just based on which party is in power and which party would like to be in power sometime in the near future. But really, I think the ideal that we should seek is just that there is lobbying on both sides, that's it not intimately tied to the sleazier sorts of exchanges of money and trips that we're talking about, because we can admit that lobbying can actually concentrate forces for justice, if it's done right, and would inevitably arise in any governmental system.", "Let me bring this up, particularly since we have two people who spend a lot of time on college campuses and with young people, I'll be interested in your thoughts here. If alumni groups weren't in the news enough already this week, a fledging group in California, UCLA, is now suggesting that they're going to offer payments to students up to $100 per class to provide information on instructors who are \"abusive, one-sided, or off topic\" in advocating political ideologies.", "This is an organization, the Bruin Alumni Association, if you were going to give it a political slant, it would slant to the right. It says it wants to expose UCLA's radical professors.", "Mary, let me start with you. You are a professor. When you hear this kind of thing, what's your thought?", "My thought is that most students, at least most of mine, wouldn't know whether what I was saying was off topic or not, simply because they're in the class to try to learn something. And so, I'm wondering if this guy who's running thing, who's a graduate, I guess, out there, whether he would know that. They have freedom of speech and freedom of expression and they can do whatever they like and if they want to spend their time doing that, let them go ahead and do it. But I think that it is crazy and if you look at the people who are on their board, some of them, they wouldn't know whether what I was saying was off topic or not.", "I mean, if I say Benjamin Franklin said if you give up your liberty for the sake of security, you deserve neither liberty nor security. Does that mean I believe we shouldn't wire tap? You know, and am I trying to give a subtle message against policy? So if they want to spend their time doing it, let them go ahead and do it. I think it's silly and it's the sign of our times in that rationality seems somehow to have escaped people on occasion.", "John McWhorter, there are those political neophytes that run around college campuses who aspire and hope to be the next you-name-it, who would, in fact, not only spurred on by the idea of being a poor college student and looking for that hundred dollars, but also trying to make their mark, if you will.", "Oh, yeah. I mean the money part is, that's bound to create, people creating things, et cetera. I think that it's sleazy, it's virtually unethical. It's very small thinking. But the idea behind this, I think, is dead on. Tenured radicals was just a cute title for a book, but it is definitely true that on college campuses there is a strong tilt to the left in what students are taught in classes in humanities and the social sciences.", "And, frankly, it's more than a tilt. And it's largely a matter of just what is not talked about. But another thing is that, one, to truly understand what goes on, does need to have some live exposure to what actually goes on. There are courses that I remember other people teaching where if you looked at the syllabus it looked okay.", "But if you actually watched the professor doing what they do, not a zealot, but clearly one was being inculcated into what was considered a certain, you know, leftist way of looking at things, such that there are many very reasonable people who think that the reason, for example, that there are so view avowed conservatives in top political science departments is because science and reason simply couldn't support any view on the right, which simply isn't true. So there is an issue that this guy is dealing with the method of getting at it, I think, shall we say, draconian.", "Well, I just, I don't, no, no...", "Looking at his Web site, you know, he also is...", "Bob, real quick.", "Yes, he's also talking about, he's against the African American studies. He's against the bias. He's talking about the biased admissions policies. You know, we can talk about this with hiring the students. That's sort of an acute issue maybe. But he's got some very serious issues on his website that could lead to something even worse going on.", "Well, what it is, all of this is part of on the political side and Bob, you're right on. It's part of the whole attack on the kinds of changes that are taking place in the academy that have made it more inclusive so that there are people there as students who wouldn't have been there before. There are classes there that wouldn't have been there before, many of which need to be there because it reflects the changes in knowledge and the changes in interest that ought to be there.", "And so this whole thing about left bias and all the rest of it is all part of an attack and one should look at the website and take the whole thing, take it whole, and decide where the motives are and whether one would support it, I would think.", "All right guys. We had hoped to get into an incident that happened last night at another NBA arena where Antonio Davis of the New York Knicks went into the stands for fear that someone was harming his wife, but we're running out of time. We'll probably pick that up tomorrow.", "Ed, it was time out though.", "It was time out, but he still went in those stands. But we'll talk about it.

Calderon's presidency faces major challenges, including price increases for basic foods. Chavez, however, is steadily consolidating power in pursuit of 21st Century socialism.", "utt": ["This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Debbie Elliott.", "Two of Latin America's most visible leaders publicly feuded this past week. Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez called Felipe Calderon the little gentleman after the Mexican president criticized Chavez's economic policies. The spat goes to the core of the leaders' very different ideologies.", "Chavez is moving ahead with his plan to implement what he calls 21st century socialism and won new power from his Congress to rule by decree. Calderon is a free market fan.", "For more, I spoke with NPR's Juan Forero, who's been in Caracas, and NPR's Lourdes Garcia Navarro in Mexico City.", "And Juan, we'll start with you. Tell us more about Chavez's new powers and his moves lately to nationalize more businesses.", "Well, the decree powers give Chavez 18 months to pass laws by decree. That means that the National Assembly does not need to vote on any of the laws. That's unusual to a lot of people because, you know, the National Assembly is completely in Chavez's hands. All 167 members are allied with the president. But the president wants to move fast and this will allow him to do it. It appears that most of the 40 to 60 laws that are expected to be passed will be in the economic sphere.", "The government talks in very general terms about what they want to do. They say that they want to transform the state to make it more efficient, to permit public participation in decision making, and they want to invest more in science and technology. But perhaps what's garnering the most headlines is the relationship with foreign firms, and they want to create a framework to govern nationalizations. The nationalizations have aroused great interest because Chavez says the government will take control of telecommunications and utilities in the next few weeks, and there's a lot of American investment in those companies.", "Now, how far is Chavez going to go with this new power and where's the opposition?", "Chavez remains very popular because he's funneled billions in oil revenues straight to the people and the opposition has been weakened to the point where they have little influence. They launched a coup in 2002 and then a strike later that year that devastated the economy. And Chavez used those errors to his advantage. He painted the opposition as pawns of the evil Bush administration, and that has worked. And the opposition continued to stumble. In 2005, they boycotted congressional elections. That's why everyone in the National Assembly is an ally of the Chavez administration.", "Let's get Lourdes Garcia-Navarro in on the conversation now. As Chavez has been trying to position himself as the heir to Fidel Castro, in Mexico you've got President Felipe Calderon, a conservative free market champion, and recently, there were words between the two leaders. Lourdes, can you tell us a little more about that flap?", "Yeah. Things were bound to head in this direction. You couldn't have two men who are more ideologically different. Still, Calderon began his term, it has to be said, by saying that he wanted rapprochement with Caracas after years of frosty relations. You have to remember, former President Vicente Fox and Chavez at one point withdrew their respective ambassadors from each other's countries. So this isn't a new tension. But on Calderon's recent trip to Europe to drum up investment for Mexico, he said that Mexico is a safer place to invest than Venezuela, for example, because Mexico is not going to nationalize industries.", "And while that did set off a firestorm in Caracas - Chavez said that Mexican policies are what are sending people north and why Mexico is so poor, etc. - it will be interesting to see how this proceeds. The United States would certainly like to see more robust repudiation of Chavez coming from within Latin America and I think it remains to be seen whether Calderon will do the U.S.'s bidding on this.", "Now, Calderon himself has been making a lot of news. He was just inaugurated in December after a bitter election battle. What he has been doing? How has he been trying to assert his authority?", "Well, Calderon immediately tried to assert his authority by tackling the drug gangs. This is a really big issue here. He's taking a page out of Columbia's book by using extraditions to the U.S. He's using the military to move into areas with the local and state authorities have been either ineffective, cowed or corrupt. This is a man, as you said, who came to power after a bitterly contested election and a very slim margin of victory. So fighting drug crime, which soared under his predecessor, is something that he's doing to try and stamp his authority immediately.", "There is a big section of the Mexican electorate that is still unhappy with Calderon. And they were out protesting again this week, protesting the high price of corn and their food staple, tortillas. How serious a challenge is this to President Calderon?", "It's quite a serious challenge. You've got to understand that Mexicans eat up to two pounds of tortillas a day. When workers take a break at lunch they go to the tortillaria and buy half a kilo or a pound for their mid-day meal. It's a staple. So when prices go up, it really affects people. Fifty percent of Mexicans live on less than $4 a day. Spending 75 cents for two pounds of tortillas, which is where prices stand right now, is a lot of money.", "I went to talk to people waiting in line at a tortilla shop yesterday and they were all blaming the government. It's the easiest target. And the left, which lost the presidential elections, has been using this issue to great advantage, saying it shows Calderon's callousness and indifference to the working classes. The union staged a march in Mexico City this week. They say this wouldn't have happened if Mexico wasn't importing about a quarter of its corn from the United States. They blame the North America Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, for destroying the Mexican countryside. Under NAFTA, it has to be said, Mexico shed about thirty percent of its farm jobs. So it's highlighted a lot of issues here that people feel very strongly about, and it is really causing some problems with Calderon and his opposition is flexing its muscles over this issue.", "NPR's Lourdes Garcia Navarro and Juan Forero.

I think, right now, in America, the place where there is most progress being made on energy conservation and being progressive and innovative, is the cities.", "Well, have you suggested turning out the light in Dallas at least for one night?", "You know, I haven't. I think that would be quite a shock to the night by the city in America, because we are the fossil fuel capital of the world. So I think, if I told them to turn the lights off, they'd think I had lost my mind, but it's a great thing and I'm glad to see it.", "What is the real iconic building on that skyline? Dallas is known as the emerald city of the prairie, I understand, and the real icon there in terms of light would be one of the bank towers?", "Yes, it's the Bank of America tower. It's 63 storeys tall. It's very, very large and all outlined in green neon. So it really is the emerald city on the prairie.", "When you see the skyline, when you look at the buildings at night, how many of those lights that are on make sense in terms of safety or efficiency that they have to be on, and how many are just really for the great look?", "Oh, most of them are for the great look. And I don't mind so much outlining the buildings. I think that's very dramatic. But certainly, we're like a lot of other cities where people leave at 5:00 to go home, and they leave their office light on and no one ever turns if off, and in that way, of course, we waste as much electricity as a lot of other folks.", "But surely, some of the buildings are lit just as a matter of policy.", "Well, sure. I mean, yeah. Some buildings are but - you know, Dallas is very progressive on a number of fronts. None of the buildings that we build anymore with our taxpayer money are anything less than lead certified - just incredibly highly energy efficient.", "But as you suggested, there are people in Texas who would say, she's not going to turn off those light in those buildings and be elected mayor again.", "Well, I don't have to worry about that because I leave office June 25th.", "Right. Well, you have a great chance then.", "Oh, no. Listen, I think it's a great idea. And I think it would be fun. But, you know, one of the reasons that, in the back of my mind, I'm nervous about turning off the lights is that we've had this enormous, wonderful grassroots effort to stop the construction of new pulverized coal plants in Texas because unfortunately our energy company's proposed doubling the number of coal plants in our state last year. And we rose up together, elected officials, to fight it back.", "But their mantra, especially TXU, which is our predominant utility here in North Texas, they said if you don't build these old style pulverized coal plants, then the lights will go out in Texas. So literally, as we've reached the peak of that fight here in the last few months, if we were to turn the lights off now, everyone would assume it was because it was true that because we didn't the coal plants we're dark.", "Laura Miller is the mayor of Dallas, Texas.

It looks like an urgent humanitarian crisis - children fleeing from countries plagued by gang violence. But it's politically fraught for president Obama and potentially for his fierce Republican critics as well.", "NPR's senior political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us to assess the chances for finding a solution to the crisis. And, Mara, the president has requested $3.7 billion to care for the children and to hire more immigration judges. What do you think the chances are for approval of this emergency aid?", "Well, I think in the end, something will get approved - not $3.7 billions. Republican say that's too high. Some Republicans are also balking at calling it emergency funding. That means it won't be offset by cuts elsewhere. Other Republicans say they don't want to write the president a blank check because he's the one who caused this problem by not securing the border. We should actually point out that these kids are not actually sneaking across the border. They are turning themselves in in the hopes of getting a hearing on asylum or at least getting to stay in the U.S. for a few years while they wait for a hearing. And that process stems from a 2008 law which is also a big subject of debate in this crisis.", "Could you explain what this law does and what the discussion is?", "The 2008 law which was passed unanimously and signed into law by George W. Bush made a distinction between how Mexican kids and Canadian kids - contiguous country kids - were handled and how Central American kids were handled. The idea was that kids who come from noncontiguous countries, especially from Central America, where they are fleeing gang violence, they are subject to sex trafficking - those kids should have a more complex legal process to make sure that they're not being sent back into dangerous situations.", "The White House wants flexibility. It wants to be able to treat the Central American kids the same way as Mexican kids - speed up the process of their hearings so they can get them sent back quicker. Some Republicans say they want the actual law changed before they'll give the president any money. And there are a lot of fault lines here.", "There are Republicans who say they want to fix the law but still provide for asylum where necessary. Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain have proposed a bill that would speed up the process for getting these Central American kids back home but, at the same time, increase the numbers of kids who could claim asylum.", "There are fault lines in the Democratic Party. Immigration advocate groups and Hispanic Caucus members and some progressive Democrats don't want the law changed. On the other hand, you have Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Leader in the House, say she's fine with having it changed because she needs - we need to solve this humanitarian crisis. And you've got the administration sending Jay Johnson, the Homeland Security Director, down to the border to these detention facilities to tell these kids you will be sent home.", "Now, Mara, if there is bipartisan cooperation on this crisis, could that brighten the prospects for immigration reform?", "I don't think so. I think the prospects for immigration reform are nil this year. John Boehner has already told the president he is not going to bring any bills up in the house this year. The president has said that he gave the House Republicans a year. He's now given up waiting for them. By the end of the summer he's going to be deciding on unilateral actions that he can take by executive authority to ease deportations. This crisis has really caused problems for the president as he tries to make these decisions on unilateral action because it riles up the anti-amnesty base of the Republican Party right before the November elections.", "Demanding the deportation of children makes for kind of ugly headlines. Could that be politically dangerous for the Republicans?", "Not in the short term. I think it's good for them in the 2014 elections because it makes the president look like he can't handle the border. But there aren't very many battleground states with large numbers of Hispanic voters. But in 2016, when Republicans will have to run in a national election, this could hurt their attempts to reach out to Hispanic voters. And they really need to do better among Hispanic voters if they're going to win the White House again.", "NPR's senior political correspondent, Mara Liasson.

But first to Cleveland, and we begin with Rachel Dissell, a reporter at The Plain Dealer, and good of you to be with us today.", "Hi Neal, nice to be with you, as well.", "And what have we learned? What's new?", "Well, I mean, we're slowly getting more details, you know, about the way in which these women were held captive, and we're also learning more about the suspects, the three brothers who were arrested. Interestingly enough, one of the things that we've been looking into is that one of the teenagers at the time, who was Gina DeJesus' friend and who talked to the police and the FBI over the years and being the last person who saw her alive, has been connected to one of the suspects as being his daughter.", "And so over the years she gave a number of interviews, you know, giving these last, you know, couple minutes that she saw Gina alive, and it was very shocking to connect the two together.", "Because two of these cases got a lot of publicity.", "That's correct. The Amanda Berry case and the Gina DeJesus case have been written about and reported extensively in the Cleveland area, mostly because Gina DeJesus' parents and Amanda Berry's mother passed away, and her family, have continued to kind of try to keep these cases in the media and to get attention for them.", "Neighborhood activists have kept stores and poles, you know, plastered with flyers for, you know, nearly a decade now with their pictures. You couldn't walk into a corner store without seeing Amanda's picture somewhere, or Gina's picture somewhere. And every year, you know, on the anniversary of these disappearances there would be vigils and other things.", "And, you know, one of the things that always comes back to me is, you know, Gina DeJesus' mom, Nancy Ruiz, would always, always, always say, you know, I know she's still out there. And a lot of people would try to say, you know, they just need to let it go, and they were never - they were always resolute that there would be, you know, an ending to this that they would find their daughter.", "Have we heard anything from the family members today?", "I have not personally. From what I've heard from some of the people who are close with them and have had contact with them, they really just want to spend some time with these family members. The family members also need to be interviewed by the police so that they can, you know, get the really vital information they need to make a case and get as much of it as they can quickly.", "However, police are also - they said that they're really taking care in the way that they interview these women, you know, with understanding they've been through great traumas, and they don't want to push them too hard. They want to give them a little bit of time, as well, with their families first to celebrate this momentous, you know, occasion.", "Amazing occasion. The third woman, though, Michelle Knight, 20 at the time that she went missing, but she was never reported missing. She was, as I understand it, believed to have been a runaway.", "Yeah, I mean, I do believe that her family did, you know, report her missing at some point, but her story is quite different. You know, she was an adult when she went missing. So the case didn't, you know, really get nearly as much attention as the other two, and was never really in any way publicly connected to them.", "My colleague here at the Plain Dealer Leila Atassi, has spoken to many of her family members who are really trying to find a way to reach her. They themselves haven't even been able to get a hold of detectives to reach out to her because they're kind of scattered. They live in different states now.", "And they, you know, they said that in their own ways, over the years, they would try to come back to the neighborhoods and canvas and ask about her, but it sounds like they didn't really have a lot of hope that they would see her again.", "Now back in 2004, and this is after Michelle Knight had vanished and after Amanda Berry had vanished, police visited the home where eventually they were found.", "Yeah, and that was, you know, on a completely separate case, you know, involving a report of a child possibly left on a school bus and not dropped off at home. You know, Ariel Castro, the man who's been arrested along with his brothers, was a Cleveland Schools bus driver for a number of years. And police and Children Family Services were just checking out a report about whether a child had been left on the bus or not.", "I believe that police, if I can remember correctly from the press conference, that police, you know, later made contact with him. They didn't believe there was any criminal act in the child being left on the bus. And so it wasn't like there was a huge investigation or a reason for them to attempt to get into this house. You know, there wasn't any other allegation other than a child had been left on a bus.", "What else do we know about the three brothers?", "We know they are all pretty close in age. The family that they belong to, the Castro family, is pretty well-known on the west side of Cleveland. Family members own, you know, corner stores. I believe there's a music store. The father of some of these folks was very well-known in the neighborhood as, you know, being a guy who ran businesses and was very generous for community causes.", "So most people in that neighborhood know the Castro family as well as most people know the DeJesus family. And the families had some, you know, connections over the years. You know, the uncle of Gina DeJesus, you know, owned a music club where people would come and dance, and Ariel Castro apparently would come play in bands in this club.", "And he knew the family at least tangentially, if not even a little bit more. You know, some people said that when Gina went missing that Ariel Castro and members of his family helped canvas, helped raise money to look for her and to pay for flyers.", "And have they been charged as yet?", "You know, I haven't seen the latest email. I know that their mug shots were just sent out. So I believe that I heard that they were going to be charged with rape and kidnapping, but I was making some other calls and working on another angle, so I'm not up to date on my email. Sorry.", "With rape, there was a young child, a six-year-old child. Do we know who the mother is? Do we know who the father is?", "We do know, according to Cleveland police, that Amanda Berry is the mother of the child. They did not talk about who the father could be or possible was. They said that they were really going to wait until they were able to hear the stories from these young ladies before they started putting the information out there.", "And they also really caution people who are getting, you know, information from, you know, anonymous sources or people who say they're family members and putting out some very specific and very upsetting information about maybe how these women were held captive. And the police and the detectives who have worked on this for years and are close with these families have really cautioned people to be careful.", "These are very sensitive details about a trauma, and to rush to misreport them is really unfair to these women, who really have been free less than, you know, 24 hours or something. So...", "And obviously they - their access to the outside world was limited to where they - do we know anything about the way they were held? Were they able to watch TV, listen to the radio, read the newspaper?", "You know, there was - you know, in Amanda Berry's own 911 tape that's been played widely, she seemed to indicate that she knew she was in the news. You know, and many people have reported, and we've also reported, that, you know, there was some physical restraint of these women up to a certain point.", "From what we've gleaned, it wasn't an exclusively kind of physical restraint of them in the house, but they may have been locked in rooms or chained up at certain times but not completely all the time and they may have had some access to wander around the house. But there's really no indication that they were able to come and go or leave from the house at all.", "Now in 2009, Cleveland Police Department went through a complete review of the way it handled missing person cases, amongst others, because of, well, mistakes were made.", "Sure, and that was based on the case of serial killer Anthony Sowell, and family who had reported their family members missing and felt like they weren't taken seriously by Cleveland police. In this case, none of the parents that we've talked to have ever said that the police weren't taking the cases seriously.", "You know, as the local newspaper here, you know, we're always the first ones to ask questions, and if there's a criticism that needs to be waged, we're going to, you know, ask the questions that probe that. In this case, there were constantly Cleveland police detectives working on this, constantly FBI agents, you know, leads every couple months.", "You know, I know that the agents and the detectives who worked on this were very close to these families, always updating them. Any tip that they called in they would check out. They went into one house and, you know, really tore it up based on a tip a couple years back. They dug up a vacant lot based on a tip. So they were really doing anything that they could to run down at least those two cases.", "We don't know as much about the investigation involving Michelle Knight yet. It seems like that was a little less of an intense investigation, possibly because she was an adult when she went missing, and her family members were unsure, you know, whether she was abducted or whether she possibly left on her own.", "What changes were instituted as a result of the review?", "As a result of the review, they moved some of the information to a centralized place that they call a fusion center to make sure that they were bringing together all the resources not only for the city of Cleveland but for the surrounding area. They also instituted some rules on certain things that have to be done in a certain amount of time in missing person cases in terms of getting a picture out, when to put a release out.", "And they also, they made some materials and some pamphlets that would be given out to families and some information so they knew what they were able to do to help find their loved one, as well, and how they could help police find their loved ones. And so that's been going on for a couple years now.", "And we hear from people that it's gotten better. And there's a couple blips here and there where someone will call and say that the protocol wasn't followed, or there is an issue with a certain missing person, but by and large missing persons cases in Cleveland, since that happened, have been getting far more attention than they would have in the past.", "And the timeline critically important because in many cases if information is not acted on very quickly, it's too late. And 10 years afterwards is extraordinary. This is great news. Thank you so much for your time today.", "Thanks.", "Rachel Dissell is a reporter for The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, and she joined us by phone from there.

It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "This is TALK OF THE NATION; I'm Neal Conan. Part of the challenge of missing persons investigations is that they're not always crimes. Teenagers run away from home, and so sometimes do adults. In 2002, wife and mother Brenda Heist vanished. Her husband was investigated and cleared. He eventually got courts to declare her legally dead.", "But then late last month she turned herself in to Florida police. She told them she left her family behind after some bad news. She was crying in a Lancaster, Pennsylvania, park when three homeless hitchhikers invited her to join them. She did, trading her life for one of sleeping under bridges, scavenging for food and begging for money. After 11 years, she'd had enough. She's now dealing with the emotional and legal fallout from her disappearance.", "If you've worked missing persons investigations, call, tell us about a case that illustrates the challenges, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION. Joining us now for more on missing person cases after the discovery of three women in a Cleveland house is Robert Lowery, executive director of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. He's also former assistant chief of police for the Florissant, Missouri, police department and joins us by phone from his office in Alexandria, Virginia. Good of you to be with us today.", "Thank you for having me, and I appreciate being on.", "And how unusual is this case in Cleveland?", "Well, it's highly unusual. It's the first time that I can tell you that we've found three women together that have been reported missing for this long a period of time. And additionally it's been the first time we've ever seen involving three abductors.", "You know, it's not unprecedented that we find long-term missing children, as you know. You mentioned a couple of the cases, but of course we know Jaycee Dugard stands out as a very visible reminder, Elizabeth Smart, as well, Shawn Hornbeck from St. Louis, from my hometown, all show us that these children can be found and returned home. So we can't always assume the worst has happened.", "And the case - in this case they were hiding in plain sight, the abductors.", "They sure were, and it's not unusual. You know, abductors and criminals, you know, they act within an area that they feel very comfortable and most - where they feel very safe, where they can move about rather unnoticed, which is what happened in this case.", "But it's also, you know, a lot of folks were asking us today is how could this have happened, and how could they have kept this a secret. Well, I think we're going to find that out in days to come, but certainly they went to great lengths to conceal their crime, to conceal these women.", "I can only imagine what these women endured for the last decade.", "You mentioned a case in St. Louis. Did you work that case?", "I did and very peripherally. Shawn Hornbeck, when he was taken, you know, he was missing from a very rural county, taken by a pedophile. All we had to work with was his bicycle that was found laying out in the street, which is really a challenge that law enforcement faces when we have an abducted child is that there's an absence of facts.", "There's - rarely do we find a credible witness or a witness that can be helpful. There's no real crime scene to work on. So all the things that we depend on as criminal investigators when we're in the field is just absence and that you have to go out there and develop your own leads, your own information and to try to find these children. That's what then makes it a very, very difficult investigation.", "And we're told on TV that the first 24, 48 hours are critical.", "Oh absolutely. You know, I think the last statistics we had was if the child were to be murdered, it would be in the first two to three hours, according to the Washington State study. But I also want to preface this as saying that not all children that are abducted are murdered, as we've seen here in this instance.", "In fact in many cases, abductions of children are custody cases.", "Well, you know, yes in some cases, and children go missing for a variety of reasons. Child custody cases are one, but I wouldn't minimize those because there's an awful lot of emotion tied to those cases and a lot of violence against those children. But we also have a lot of runaway children and often dismissed as just a behavioral problem, when in fact we see many of these children are running away from a situation, say an abusive home, or maybe even in other cases they're being lured by a predator.", "So we don't minimize any missing child case, and we want to remind everyone that we consider all these child endangered, and we've got to get them found and get them returned home as quickly as we can.", "And what can you tell us about the demographics of the abducted? Are they mostly young people, or are they - what can you tell us?", "Well, it depends on the type of scenario, but when you have a case like what we had last night, you know, those generally are females, generally the school age. We said that the children on abductions are most vulnerable, according to our analysis, either going to or coming from school or a school-related event.", "You know, it's a time that they're oftentimes alone. They're walking. And what we tell parents is that we don't want children frightened to the point that they don't leave home, but empower your kids and tell them it's OK to say no if someone tries to lure them into a car. It's OK to run. And if someone grabs them, we urge the children - the parents to tell the children kick, scream, bring as much attention to that situation as they possibly can.", "We're talking about missing cases, cases of missing persons. If you're an investigator who's worked one of those cases, give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email talk@npr.org. And we're going to start with John(ph), John's on the line with us from the Upper Peninsula in Michigan.", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Afternoon.", "I was just listening to your person, I don't know who it was exactly because I turned my radio off, and I worked in child protection for over 20 years in Michigan. And we used to discuss that really safeguarding children or young people is a community responsibility. And I looked at my job as responsibly to investigate complaints or situations where a child might be in danger or in harm.", "And it's real clear to me that we could only do so much, by we I mean authorities through child protection, police and court. I recall several instances where - in fact this is a remarkable situation where you have stranger abduction and 10 years of confinement.", "What we typically were involved in was children who are hurt by family members. And I can recall a couple situations that might be similar to what you're looking at, where young women who, in Michigan at the time I was working, there was a limbo area of between 17 and 18 where courts did not have authority, and parents really did not have authority through the courts or police, to make that 17-year-old live with them or go to school or do things that we would normally expect of younger children.", "And a number of young women would put themselves in dangerous situations. One I recall was I had worked with a family whose 16-year-old daughter was rebelling, and a mother asked for some assistance because of some things that the stepfather was threatening to do to the child. And we resolved that somewhat, and then about - some time later, maybe within a year, that child had turned 17.", "And the mother was calling me asking for help because the child had run away with her biological father. And I said, well, there's really not much we could do. And then she let me know that it wasn't just a father-daughter relationship, that this man, who had been in prison, or not in the child's life, had taken his daughter in a sexual way, also, so, you know, really coerced her emotionally and physically to be subject to him.", "We often dealt with young women who would attach themselves to young men, anywhere from 16 to 17 years of age. I think I heard somebody talking earlier on the radio about somebody living under a bridge.", "Yes.", "We had a young woman who was adopted by very well-to-do, upstanding citizens, the father was a college professor. She ran away from home at age 16, late 16 years of age. The courts tried to deal with it. By the time she was 17, the courts could no longer have authority over her, and she had attached herself to a young man who - in fact they were living under a bridge, scavenging for food and trying to survive.", "I later dealt with that family in a child protection situation where this woman, this young girl and then - or older girl and then young woman, had children with this young man. And they were neglectful. There was issues of sexual assault and physical abuse towards the children. And unfortunately the community has had to deal with not just the harm to that child, the original mother and teenager, but also the harm to her children.", "And it's again a very large persistent problem that the community has, really, difficulty grappling with in many ways.", "Thanks, John, for the call. It's a very sad situation so many times.", "Yeah, it is distressing, and I think our hearts go out to all young people who are hurting. And again this is a very dramatic situation that came out through the news in Cleveland, and again I would just emphasize that as difficult and as dangerous as those situations are, more commonly it's a family, inter-family issues that cause harm to children.", "John, thanks very much.", "You're welcome.", "And let's see if we can get another caller in. Let's go to Dave, and Dave's on the line with us from Miami.", "Hey, how are you?", "Very well, thanks.", "Yes, I had a case that was up in Atlanta some years back. One of the biggest issues that we bring (technical difficulties) missing person case is, of course, (technical difficulties) child. We did finally recover a body in the general area. Of course, it's so decomposed. What we had to do is try to reconstruct the way that person may have looked at the time. And, you know, based on bone structure, based on several other factors, and it made really difficult to identify this person, but, fortunately, the reconstruction was good enough to get a decent composite of what that person looked like.", "We were able to then go back and check through the cases and match up the DNA and so forth. But once you finally have that person, you know, identified, well, then you have a whole other issue, and that's trying to figure out, OK, well, who did this? And I think if there's one thing that if I could, you know, make a suggestion, you know, on the air, we have a major issue with putting sex offenders right back in the community. If a person goes to their local state and types in the sex offender registry, puts in their address, they would be dumbfounded how many of these people live right within, you know, walking distance of their home.", "But I think if there's some new legislation to, you know, put these people behind bars and really keep them back there, we would see missing cases drop significantly. And I know in states where they take a harder stance against some of the sex offenders instead of just treatment (technical difficulties) we've seemed those numbers drop significantly.", "Well, I understand what you're saying. Of course, not every sex offender reoffends. But, Robert Lowery, what do you think of that suggestion?", "Well, I agree. I mean, not everyone does reoffend, but we do keep an eye on the ones that - that are out there (unintelligible) there are high rates of recidivism among sex offenders. But he - this gentleman does bring up another topic that we work on every day here is that remains of children that are found, and they're not been identified. And right now, we're - we - here at the National Center, we're assisting on over 650 such cases that we believe to be long-term missing children.", "Your caller is correct. It's very difficult to start a homicide investigation on those cases until we can identify those children, put a name to them because that's where that investigation really starts in earnest, so we could track where they've been and the activity and who they may have been with. But it is a dilemma. And it's one that we are addressing here at the National Center.", "Dave, did you ever find out who did the murder that you're talking about?", "The family was - the child's murderer was never identified. However, there were a couple of people that were picked up in related cases that more than likely that was the killer. But it's something we may never know. It's kind of like the Ann Walsh case. I mean, that is one where there are some pretty good speculation but we're probably never going truly know. But, you know, that's the tragedy of this is, you know, the gentleman mentioned the recidivism rate is extremely high among sex offenders.", "And when we talk about, hey, we keep track of them, well, it depends on what you define as keeping track. I mean, we know where they live, but we don't have the manpower to be watching a hundred people in one small community at the same time. And if there's one another message, I guess, I can really get across to parents is watch your kids, never let them out of your sight, you know? I don't think kids should ride to, you know, school on their bike by themselves or walk to school by themselves, even if it's only a block or, you know, two blocks away.", "It is really amazing to me how many times I'm just out and about, and I have kids too. And I see some little child just walking around by themselves, you know, completely unsupervised. And it's no wonder that we have some many missing today. And I think as parents, we're a little more proactive about keeping their eyes on their kids at all times whether it's in a store, whether it's, you know, different, you know, places, you know, going to and from school.", "That would reduce the number of missing kids significantly. But, you know, like I say, I think we definitely need to have some new laws at least structure how many - how we track these folks and whether we should let them out at all depending on the crime.", "Well, that's a pretty sobering recommendation to be - and in any case, a lot of people would argue and - well, thank you very much for the call, Dave. A lot of people would argue that at least in the cases that people have served their sentences or they've done their time, and then they're still being serving - being punished for crimes for which they've already served their time. And if they're going to change that, you need to change the laws, as you suggest. I'm Neal Conan.

They had investigations and leads, and one of the Topeka Police Department had a - like a local cold case show, and then they've got some more leads off of that and - but as far as I know, they haven't come up with anything yet.", "And then you hear about a situation like the one from Cleveland, and you must have mixed emotions.", "I'm just terribly happy for them people.", "Of course, you are. Of course, you are.", "Thanks.", "Well, Neal, if I could add, is that there are a lot of parents like Olin in our country today that are desperately looking for their children that need answers to what happened. And it's important that the public stays engaged as reminders that we are still looking for Olin's son or his daughter, that there's someone out there that has information that might help find the child, and that they need to call police or call us here at the National Center with that information because, like I say, not all - and I think it's important for Olin to know that we can't always assume the worst, although I think we face the same harsh realities when children are gone this long a period of time. But I think these children last night, they are proof that things do happen. There are miracles out there, and we can't let go of that hope.", "And you can't let go of that hope, Olin. Thank you so much.", "Yeah. Yeah. She's listed with the National Center, and I appreciate everything they're doing.", "Thank you, Olin. We'll keep working.", "Thank you.", "And one last question, Robert Lowery. We used to famously see children's pictures on milk cartons. Where is the information posted today?", "Well, you know, that's funny that you mentioned it. That actually was a program of many years ago. It wasn't very successful, unfortunately, but it seems to be the thing that most people seemed to remember about missing children posters. But now, today, we have, you know, the ability to engage the public through 24-hour news stations, smartphones have been a blessing for us when the missing children - when we're looking for missing children because we can engage the public real time.", "And one of your early callers just say something that's important is that it's important that the public stay engaged when we're looking for children because they are the eyes and ears of law enforcement. When they see something or they see a child that resembles a missing child, they need to not hesitate. They need to report as quickly as they can because that's how we find these kids.", "Thanks very much. We appreciate your time today.", "Thank you, Neal.", "Robert Lowery.

But that bedrock of the country's retirement system is in trouble. The government agency that insures pensions faces a huge deficit, and financially struggling companies owe more than $100 billion to their pension plans.", "President Bush said today's bill will force companies to help close those funding gaps.", "President GEORGE W. BUSH: The message from this administration and from those of us up her today is this - you should keep the promises you make to your workers. If you offer a private pension plan to your employee, you have a duty to set aside enough money now so your workers will get what they've been promised when they retire.", "The bill will make companies pay nearly $6 billion more in premiums to the government's beleaguered Pension Insurance Agency. It will also tighten loose accounting rules, which allowed many companies to under fund their pensions in the first place.", "But those changes will also make it harder for companies to predict how much they'll owe their pension plans in the future. And it could persuade some of them to halt their pension plans altogether, undermining the very purpose of the bill. Ron Gebhardtsbauer is senior pension fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries.", "This new bill is going to increase the contributions that employers have to pay into their pension plan. In fact, it could increase it by 25 to 50 percent at some companies. So some employers may decide that they want to get out of the traditional pension plan and move over to the 401K arrangement for their employees.", "And everyone agrees that that would be a loss for workers. Traditional pensions tend to be more generous and more reliable because they pay a fixed amount every month. 401K plans are subject to the ups and downs of the stock market and put more responsibility on the employee to save for retirement. Again, Ron Gebhardtsbauer.", "We actually have seen that individuals don't save enough, they retire too early, they spend their money down too fast and they're more likely to run out of money in their 80s, when they can't go back to work.", "If some companies don't like the accounting changes in today's legislation, they're even more concerned about the changes coming in December from the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

A computer, in other words, decided that Oklahoma would get to play in this game over Texas and Texas Tech, even though Texas beat Oklahoma during the regular season on a neutral field, and had the same record as Oklahoma. So, the answer to that question, in my long-winded way, is no.", "OK. But if Oklahoma loses tomorrow, would that mean that Texas gets to play for the national title?", "Very possibly, it could - although it's not a guarantee. Again, USC plays a game tomorrow; Texas does not play a game tomorrow. It's possible the computer might move USC past Texas, and then USC would get to play the winner of Florida-Alabama in the national championship game as opposed to Texas. So, we just don't know and again, the sad thing is much of this will not be decided on the football field.", "OK. What about the other BCS bowl games? Is it confusion there, too?", "Total confusion, as usual. One team from a non-BCS conference - there are six BCS conferences - will be in one the BCS bowls. That's Utah, they're guaranteed a spot; they're 12 and 0. But Boise State is also undefeated from a non-BCS conference, and I'm willing to bet you a lot of money that on Sunday, they're going to say Ohio State, with a 10 and 2 record out of a BCS conference, gets to go to one of the big bowls over Boise State, even though Ohio State didn't beat a quality opponent all year. That's not computers, that's politics.", "Now, there are people who would defend BCS, in fact, support it. Is there a quick way for you to explain why the BCS schools refused to adopt a playoff system, why they like this whole system?", "There's a very quick way - money. They don't want to share the money with the rest of Division I - that the non-BCS schools or with the smaller schools in Division II and Division III, and Division 1AA of the NCAA. Ninety-five percent of the BCS money goes to the 66 BCS schools right now. Those presidents don't want to share the wealth, even though they're remarkably short-sighted because not only would a playoff system be fairer to the players, but it would ultimately make them more money because a playoff, even though they'd have to spread the money out, would probably be worth two or three times what the BCS is currently worth.", "OK. Let's end on a high note, and that's the one game completely unaffected by the Bowl Championship Series. Your favorite game of the year...", "Right.", "Army-Navy, in Philadelphia?", "Yeah. They're playing in Philadelphia tomorrow, as you said. Navy has won this game six straight years - that had never happened in more than a 100 years of this rivalry until now. They've done a remarkable job to be as competitive as they've been in a time of war, because it's hard to recruit to a military academy during a time of war.

You know, Cubans don't get the news as quick as we do. It takes a little while. And the official government communications here has been actually quite mum on the situation. So they don't really know what those details are and when they will come.", "Well, is there evidence that President Obama's approach just wasn't working exactly as he advertised?", "Well, I think that's tough to say. You know, it's only been two years. Although the opening of the economy began before the Obama warming with Cuba. It started about 2011. But, you know, on the short answer, you do see great changes in Cuba comparatively. You know, it's very, the opening of the economy. And people are, you know - they want that happening - they want that opening happening quicker. And they see this more as a step backwards.", "You know, the president's announcements today, at least as it's been described to us, sounds like the president's approach to Iran, another country where Trump was very critical of Obama's policies, is ending up keeping those basic policies but working around the edges, looking for little ways to stick it to a government that he strongly opposes.", "Yeah.

Hi, Scott.", "Morning, David.", "So this plan from President Obama, we should say, never actually went into place. Why was that?", "It was blocked by the courts before it ever went into effect, much like the current status of President Trump's immigration ban. A federal appeals court held that block up. It went before the Supreme Court last year. But that was the period when the Supreme Court only had eight members. They deadlocked 4-4. They issued a ruling just a couple sentences long. And what that did was kept the lower court ruling in place, putting it in this limbo status. And at the time, everyone just thought this will be decided by the next president. Now it appears to have been that - so.", "All right, so if you're President Trump, you don't like this policy. But it never actually went into effect. It was caught, as you say, in legal limbo. What is President Trump doing? Why now and, yeah, why?", "Well, they're rescinding it. The statement in the release that came out last night from Homeland Security Secretary Kelly said that there just wasn't a path forward here. You know, the timing is interesting. It came on the five-year anniversary of President Obama signing a different immigration order meant to protect people brought into the country illegally when they were children. But President Trump did campaign on overturning DAPA.", "It was part of his hard-line immigration stance that really resonated with Trump voters, with early Trump supporters.

So it was a feeling of, like, civil discourse and a moment away from the normal politics we see in Washington.", "Yeah. And lawmakers from both parties seemed really sincere about wanting to make things more civil. They're certainly not going to get on the same page in terms of policy any time soon. But they said that one step you can take is just talking to each other more civilly.", "Well, this is an artifact of an older style of politics in Washington, which can seem hypocritical from the outside - and maybe it actually is hypocritical, but it sometimes works - where lawmakers essentially say to each other, there's nothing personal here. This is just politics, these horrible things I'm saying to you in public. We actually can sort of get along.", "And then go out to dinner, even after...", "Or to a game.", "...We've said all those terrible things.", "Yeah.", "Yeah.

One police official last night said that he hoped that the death toll would not rise into triple digits.", "And now we have a criminal investigation...", "Yeah.", "...Which is a big move. Why is that?", "Well, you know, the residents, if you remember, they complained repeatedly about fire safety violations in the building and warned that it would take a catastrophe just like what we've seen to get the management company to act. There's been growing anger. A man named David Lammy - he's a member of parliament with the Labour Party - called this corporate manslaughter.

Marilyn Geewax, NPR's senior business editor is just back from a briefing by the industry group that generates the summer air travel projection every year and she joins us here in studio 42. Nice to have you with us again.", "Hi Neal.", "And what did you learn?", "This is going to be a reasonably good summer, it looks like. Now, keep in mind the airline industry has just been battered for years. They have had a horrible time in the recession: bankruptcies, losses, mergers. Just one thing after another. But it seems like this year, they sort of figured it out and so have the passengers. They started in 2008 when the recession started deepening to add these fees, you know, the baggage fees that we all find so irritating.", "We all hate. Yes.", "$25, $35, whatever, and then fees for everything: for Wi-Fi, for leg room, for all these various fees.", "Soon they're going to charge us for the emergency oxygen.", "Well, there are all kinds of crazy plans for boosting those fees but last year, the fees totaled about $6 billion, and that was their whole profit margin. Basically, they break even on the air fares and they figured out that if they charge enough of those fees, they can actually turn a little bit of a profit. But they need those profits. They're taking that money and they're trying to reinvest in things like new equipment, upgrading customer lounges, the airport terminals need more Wi-Fi. I mean, there are lots and lots of upgrades that have been deferred during the recession and now they're getting enough money in those fees that they're able to start to turn the corner and upgrade the industry.", "And what does that say about the American economy?", "Well, in all the surveys, really, I've looked at a whole lot of things, various organizations that see where people are heading this summer and it looks like everything is pointing up a little bit. Not gangbusters, not going through the roof, but people do want to travel again this year and that's what this association, the Airlines for America, which is the trade group representing airlines, they're predicting that the number of people getting on planes this year will be about 209 million, and that's the best we've seen since 2008.", "And that represents an increase of 1 percent, and like a lot of the things in this report, tiny increments.", "Yes. Everything is a matter of, you know...", "...it's a game of inches for these guys. They don't make a lot of money. They're not attracting the crowds they used to have, you know? In 2007, we had 217 passengers. So, you know?", "Million, that is.", "Or 217 million passengers. So they're inching back up, getting back to where they want to be but all of it is a tough climb but they're getting there. And I think the overall sense both with the economy and with all the travel segments is that we're reaching kind of a new normal where people have settled into the idea that yes, I'm going to have to pay these fees but I accept that and I'm willing to start to travel again.", "Let's get some callers on in this conversation of how have your plans changed one summer to the next. Do you plan to travel more by air this summer? 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. And Catherine's(ph) on the line with us from Berkeley.", "Hello. Thank you for taking my call. When we made our decision to travel this summer, we thought about how could we better ourselves? How could we view air travel to increase, like the kid's resumes going to sports camps or music camps or it wasn't just a whimsical trip. It was tied into kind of future advancement, basically. And...", "An investment.", "Oh, that's just - yeah, yeah. So it's just - and, of course, we would take side trips and see family or do fun things, but it was kind of like we justified it by making these choices based on helping us in the future. Thank you.", "I like the distinction that you had there between seeing family and doing fun things.", "So yeah, we did make - we are traveling more, but it's making us better somehow.", "Thinking carefully about it. And I think that's a good point, Marilyn.", "Yes. Neal, this is really, exactly - the sentiment that she's expressing is what a lot of surveys are finding. Like I said, people do kind of want to travel again. It's not so over the top, not all, you know, wild travel and crazy parties. It's not over the top at this point. But it's moving the way the airline industry and the way the travel industry wants. People are much more open this year to the idea of staying in a hotel, going to the beach, whatever, instead of just doing the phrase we heard so much during the peak of the recession, was the staycation where people would just simply stay home and try to have fun.", "But they're willing to get out a little bit more this year, and that'll be good for jobs as well, that that should help strengthen the economy in terms of creating jobs for people in the hospitality industry, restaurants and so forth.", "Let's go next to Thomas, and Thomas on the line with us from Iowa.", "Good afternoon. I just want to make a comment. We just arrived back home from a trip to New Zealand, and we don't really have a choice just to drive obviously. But we noticed this time around that, not only the extra fees going up, like carry-on bags and the checked luggage are increasing, but also it's more and more difficult with family, young children. We have two young children. And it used to be where they would let family members on a plane first to get situated and sorted.", "Well, now they're even cutting that out, some airlines. It just makes it more difficult than I've ever used to be, and I guess I wasn't quite sure why. It doesn't cost the airline money to let a young family board the plane early, but yet they're eliminating that now.", "Well, they are selling the privilege to board the plane early.", "Right. That's it. The thing is they are trying to put a price tag on just about anything that you like. If you like to get on early, there's going to be a price for that. If you want more legroom, if you want to take another bag, just about anything that you want, they're going to find a way to stick a price tag on that, that little bit of extra comfort.", "In the story you filed for our website, npr.org, Marilyn, you noted that Frontier Airlines is going to charge up to $100 for one carry-on bag for any customer who fails to book directly through the website. So your carry-on, not the check bag, your carry-on bag, 100 bucks.", "Boy, that's a tough one. I wonder if that one will stick. The - Frontier says it's going to add that fee for this summer, and we'll see if they can keep up their business. But they want you to come only through their own website, not using third party transactions. That way...", "Not Expedia or one of those.", "Right. You know, the one at Orbitz or any of those. They want to steer you to their website. And also, they just basically want to discourage you from bringing carry-ons because there has been a real surge, as you can imagine. With all these fees over the years, people have learned to kind of stuff everything into that overhead and then jam it up there and a lot of tussles on flights. It's tough for the flight attendants because there are always people jockeying to get those bags up there.", "And if they could discourage that, they would. It's funny, I've seen on websites, there are these wearable luggage companies now where you can get a coat that has really, really big pockets, and you can just sort of try to stick all your luggage onto your body and then walk on to the plane wearing your luggage. So that's a trend.", "If you want to read Marilyn's - and, Thomas, thanks very much for the call.", "You're welcome. Thank you.", "And if you wanted to read Marilyn's piece she wrote after her return from the A4A Conference, you can go to our website, npr.org, click on TALK OF THE NATION. And let's see if we can get next to - this is Joe, and Joe is on the line with us from San Mateo in California.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I am planning, this year - or this summer rather - to go to Europe. I was awarded a scholarship to study Czech in the Czech Republic for a month. And this is my first time I've really gone out and started pricing tickets, and one thing that struck me in particular was the difference between what the airlines call the fare and then the fee and taxes.", "On a flight to Europe where I am trying to do an open-ended ticket, well, multi-city ticket through London and then to Prague, the fare was about $1,700, half of which is what they considered the fare, and then half of which was fees and taxes and so forth, which I thought was kind of interesting. And I, you know, I wonder, you know, if that's different or if that's an increase. Is that something new?", "These fees have been just continually going up, and some of them are new because every time they think of something new that they could charge you a fee for, it shows up. As I said, this trend really began in 2008 as the recession was deepening, and we've seen it growing all the time. Well, one of the big fees is - has to do with change fees. You know, they are now up to as much as $200 to change your fee - it's not even...", "(Unintelligible).", "...you know, to change the flight. It's just such a high fee that it's just not worth it anymore. So you end up having to buy a whole new ticket. So that's also another huge source of revenues for the airlines, and all of these things add up. And, of course, governments are looking for new revenue streams, so there are an awful lot of taxes that get added to flights. But, you know, Neal, if you think about it, when you go to a restaurant, there's a sort of a list price on meal.", "But then when you find out what the taxes are and the, you know, and then $2 for a cup of coffee or $5, whatever they want to charge, by the time you're all done with it, it's a great deal more than what you were thinking of originally. So I think we see that in a lot of different formats, whether it's going to a movie theatre and finding out you're getting this $6 popcorn, you know? It - every...", "(unintelligible) more, it's twice as much.", "Right. Well, every industry has its way of boosting its profits because they try to break even on their core business and then make their profits on these add-ons. And that's what we're - the airline industry has figured out. And that's why they're starting to see a little bit of a brighter future for themselves.", "Joe, have a great trip.", "And can I make this one quick note? Also, our family is also going to go to Wisconsin on an annual trip from the Bay Area and that hasn't changed. And so I guess we're part of the trend that's incrementally increasing our travel.", "OK. Thanks very much for the call.", "Sure.", "We're talking with Marilyn Geewax about the projection of this summer's air travel. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "There's another big variable in this equation for the airlines, Marilyn, and that's the price of fuel and oil prices going down.", "Yes. They've seen some, at least, a better trend line. Remember at the beginning of the year, we are all very concerned about gas - gasoline prices. If you were driving car it was pretty horrifying. And back in February, early March we saw the prices going up, up, up. And now they backed off. I think that's still very high, but it's basically the same story for the airlines.", "They were very concerned about the volatility and the rising oil prices. And now, we, sort of, settled into a kind of an - I wouldn't call it a great range. I mean, from the airlines point of view, they certainly wish jet fuel were cheaper, but it sort of stabilized at a level that they feel they can work around as long as they can keep up enough people traveling this summer.", "And, of course, one of the things they've been concerned about is the government - if Congress would make life a little bit easier for them. But one of the things they're worried about this spring was the sequestration. You may remember that problem.", "Sure. And people stopped flying because they were worried about big flight delays.", "Right. That was the situation where Congress was - had ordered some cuts in spending. So they were automatic across the board spending cuts that resulted in the FAA saying that they would have to furlough air traffic controllers. That situation went on for about six days in mid-April.", "And what happened was lots of air traffic controllers were at home instead of in the towers. And as a result, there was really - there were lots of flight delays. The industry says there were 7,200 flight delays that affected about 600,000 people. So the big concern there was that, if that continued, if they were going to have both higher jet fuel prices and flight delays, boy, that look kind of scary.", "And now, both of those situations seem to have been resolved. Congress took some action, along with White House, they all agreed to ease up on those air traffic controller furloughs. They're still spending cuts but they're just hitting in a different way. So the flight delays have gone away as a result of that. And you're seeing this - just sort of more a stable environment for the airlines.", "Let's go next to Nonny(ph). And Nonny with us from New Bern in North Carolina.", "Hi. I was just going to comment that, you know, a lot of people - you might think that the airlines don't care at all about the customer any more, but I just recently found that they're completely the opposite.", "We're not planning to travel this summer, but recently my father-in-law had a heart attack and most - my husband and his brother had to travel by air, very suddenly. My brother-in-law went online. His ticket ended up being a $1,000. My husband called the airline explaining his problem. Ended up flying out of a very small town airport, which is typically much more expensive for less than $200. So it's, you know, they were willing to work with us when they knew what was going on.", "Well, that's a good thing about an upward spiral like this, where things get a little bit easier for the airlines and the employees, I think, can feel a little less cranky.", "You can imagine, if you were an airline employee in 2008, '09, '10, it was awful. There were lots of layoffs, lots of mergers, lots of bankruptcies. People, you know, it's kind of hard to come and feeling cheaper everyday when your job is in such turmoil. And now that things have, sort of, smoothed out a great deal, what the surveys are showing is that customers would like someone to maybe smile at them. And the workers are a little bit more inclined to smile. So the J.D. Power and Associates did this survey of how people feel about the airlines. And also, you know, there are - they keep track of customer complaints about things like mishandled bags and all that. Every measure that I could find, of customer satisfaction, it looks like things are getting a little bit better. The customers are seeing a few...", "From a low bar but moving...", "Right. And that's not to say - believe me, I've been on many flights, packed there in, you know, coach class and it's pretty darn miserable, but not as miserable as it used to be.", "Well, there is a sunny. Nanny, how's your father-in-law doing?", "He's doing wonderfully great, great. Full recovery.", "Glad to hear it. And glad to hear that the - your family members got there in time to be with him at the moment of crisis.", "Thank you.", "Thanks very much for the phone call. And, Marilyn, so things are slightly less miserable than before.", "Always good to have you on the program. And a real sunny forecast for this summer.", "It's great to be with you, Neal.", "Marilyn Geewax is NPR's business editor - senior business editor - excuse me - I wouldn't want to miss that.

A North Korean ship was stopped there as it was cruising through the Panama Canal carrying military supplies from Cuba. Missile and aircraft parts were hidden beneath bags of sugar in the cargo hold. North Korea is subject to a U.N. arms embargo and the North Korean crew is said to have violently resisted an effort to inspect the ship. NPR's Tom Gjelten has the latest.", "Just about every aspect of this story is bizarre. Two states, both fiercely anti-American, engage in a secret arms transaction that could well be in violation of a U.N. embargo. The North Korean crew puts up a fight. The ship captain allegedly tries to kill himself. Under thousands of bags of sugar, the cargo.

They're terribly old, but they're what Cuba have.", "As for the missile components, they've been identified by arms experts as part of an SA2 system, an anti-aircraft package that by its age, could have been in Cuba since the 1960s when Fidel Castro worried the United States was going to attack him. So why would Cuba send this stuff to North Korea? Hugh Griffith(ph) is an arms traffic specialist at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute and he has an explanation.", "Not only do North Koreans offer military equipment, but they can provide very low cost technicians to service, repair or upgrade relatively unsophisticated Soviet era military equipment.", "So maybe the North Koreans were going to service the equipment for the Cubans, being paid in sugar, a barter arrangement, good both for food-starved North Korea and cash-starved Cuba. Or maybe the North Koreans bought the old equipment from Cuba with the intention of upgrading it and reselling it to someone else. David Wright, a missile expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says it's hard to see how the Cubans could figure that that old anti-aircraft missile system, even upgraded, would be of any use against the U.S. Air Force.", "The radars that go along with it, if they have not been updated, are probably not very good. And because it's been around so long, countries like the United States and Japan and other countries have long ago figured out how to fool the - jam the radar systems. And so, to a modern adversary it's probably not a big threat.", "Meanwhile, the downside to Cuba of this transaction, the risk of getting caught engaging in a possibly illicit transaction with North Korea seems huge. Hal Klepak isn't sure what to think.", "It may well have been an expensive mistake for Cuba.", "Frank Mora, until recently the top Pentagon official responsible for Western Hemisphere affairs, says he's scratching his head trying to understand what the Cubans were thinking. After all, he points out, Raul Castro has been saying he wants better relations with the United States.", "This doesn't make sense because it doesn't fit with a more pragmatic approach that Raul Castro had versus his brother. This is a very high-risk effort to try to smuggle these engines and other things for very little gain.", "The United States and Cuba, in fact, are currently engaged in talks to restore mail service between the two countries and to update an agreement on how to handle Cuban migration to the United States.

Now, you know, they still lost because you can only turn out people who support you.", "On to framing, an idea that in general seems pure common sense - make a good argument. But since the 2004 election, the work of linguist George Lakoff has taken off among some Democrats to the point where Lakoff offers briefings to powerful politicians, telling them that the key to victory lies in the right phrases and soundbites. William Galston is not a believer.", "The emphasis on framing and language has functioned as one more excuse for the Democratic Party not to think harder about what it's agenda ought to be.

In Nigeria Saturday, Muslims attacked Christian churches amid riots that left at least 15 people dead. Friday, protests claimed lives in Libya and Pakistan. Pakistani journalist and scholar Ahmed Rashid offers his insights to Debbie Elliott.", "utt": ["Across the world, Muslims continue to rally and protest, and in some instances to riot against the now-infamous Danish cartoons. Today in Northern Nigeria Muslims angered over the cartoons attacked Christians and burned churches. At least 15 people were killed. In Eastern Pakistan, police opened fire on a crowd trying to burn down shops. Four people were wounded. Another large protest was planned for tomorrow in Islamabad, but the authorities there have declared a ban on demonstrations in the city. In London, 15,000 people marched peacefully from Trafalgar Square to Hyde Park.", "It's been five months since the original publication of the cartoons, which lampooned the prophet Muhammad, and it's been nearly three weeks since they were re-published in some European newspapers, sparking the current round of protests. Many in the West continue to scratch their heads, unsure how much of this anger is really about the cartoons at all. We decided to pose the question to Ahmed Rashid. He's a Pakistani journalist and author, and he's on the line from Lahore. Welcome.", "Thank you.", "So Mr. Rashid, are these protests really about the cartoons?", "Well, at one level, certainly. I mean there's no doubt that these cartoons have been very provocative and Muslims have felt very insulted by them, and the vast majority of Muslims don't see this as an issue of free speech the way the West has been posing it. But it must be said that at another level in each different country I think that these demonstrations we're seeing in the Muslim world, all of them have double and triple agendas. It's not just cartoons. I mean we've seen, for example, in Syria and in Iran, where you had state-sponsored demonstrations which burnt down the Danish Embassy. Now, both Syria and Iran of course are facing huge pressure from the West, so they have reason to, if you like, get some of this anger out by, you know, burning down Danish embassies and things.", "But we've also seen huge demonstrations in countries like Turkey, where the Islamic Right has come out. Some 50,000 people came out in Istanbul, which is a huge number, in a totally secular state. Now, I think there the message clearly was you've still got an Islamic Right wing which is against Turkey joining the European Union. You've got several layers of politics there. I think the same probably goes for Egypt and for Libya. In Pakistan, there has been mounting opposition to General Musharaf, who is now in his sixth year of military rule, and he wants to run as President for another five years. The opposition is led by an alliance of Islamic parties who are in Parliament, and also extremist Islamic groups linked to Bin Laden.", "So you have now a growing Islamic opposition which is using this cartoon issue to try and mount a campaign to house Musharaf.", "How is that happening?  Is there an organized effort for this?", "Very much so. What we've seen over the last couple of days is organized street demonstrations, many of which turn into riots, and then burning and smashing and looting takes place. Now, the alliance of Islamic parties have ordained that every two days in a major city in Pakistan, there will be a massive strike, shutdown and demonstration.", "Now, I think I just need a little help understanding how the outrage over these cartoons is related to people's attitude against President Musharaf.", "Well, I think the cartoon issue has really hurt people immensely. I mean I think much more than the flushing of the Korans in the toilet in Guantanamo or the kicking of the Korans or torturing prisoners in Abu Ghraib and the pictures that have recently appeared. Much more than that, an insult to the Prophet is really taken very, very personally by Muslims. So that has had the capacity to bring out hundreds of thousands of very aggrieved people. And the government has been seen to be far too weak in dealing with that.", "And what we've got across the Muslim world is that people are frustrated that their governments are powerless in front of the West. They're not capable, you know, there've been demands, for example, to break ties with Denmark, to break ties with the European countries. Obviously Muslim governments aren't willing to do that for a whole variety of very sensible reasons. But that has not been seen in the press by the public. They're seeing their governments weak and incapable of defending what they consider Islam's interest against an ever- encroaching West in this kind of battle of wills we've seen since 9/11.", "I have a question about the riots. The targets of the violence aren't necessarily Western embassies or Danish missions. Why is that?", "It's been quite terrible. I mean my own brother-in-law was on the road in Peshawar, and his car was utterly smashed. He was badly wounded. And he's, you know, a resident and a citizen of that city. So I mean, you know, the targeting has been totally indiscriminate and un-understandable. And I think, you know, this is part of this kind of wider picture, the growing frustration amongst young people, the joblessness, inflation, anger at the regime for not resolving their problems. Something, for example, that we saw in France last month, setting fire to things. I think what we're going through is something like that process.", "Do you think these protests are somehow a watershed in relations between the Muslim world and the West?", "I think they really are, because what I see at the moment is that the Muslim world really has no answer to the demonstrations going on. It has no answer in how to contain them, what to tell its own people, it has no answer what to tell the West. It is unable to unite on these issues. And on the West's side, I think the Europeans are utterly at a loss. I spoke to a European ambassador yesterday and he told me very clearly that all the European Union ambassadors have been ordered not to apologize to anyone about anything related to the cartoon issue.", "Now, if the Europeans are going to act tough like that, then certainly there's no give. So I think we really are at a watershed.", "Ahmed Rashid is a journalist and author of a book called Taliban: Militant Islam, Oil and Fundamentalism in Central Asia.

We planned originally to talk with I. King Jordan, the outgoing president of Gallaudet. But given the protest that shut down the school last week, he cancelled his appearance. The school is back open today after more than 100 students were arrested on Friday, but the protests continue.", "Malia Woodard(ph) e-mailed us to explain why Gallaudet and its president are so important. The role that I. King Jordan plays in the deaf community is not limited to university president. He's a role model for deaf individuals and for advocates of deaf education all over the world. Keep in mind that in most parts of the world, deaf education at any level does not exist. That's why this is so important, why the stakes are so high. Students want a strong leader, one who represents the deaf experience.", "We also talked about the debate over cochlear implants, technology that allows some deaf people to hear, at least to a degree. The issue divided the deaf community for years.", "Allison Anderson(ph) e-mailed to tell us: As a deaf person who was born profoundly deaf, I just got a cochlear implant three months ago. The militant deaf keep saying that the implant is bringing on the destruction of their culture. I don't think it's the cochlear implant that is destroying the culture. I came into a deaf environment eager to learn with an open mind. And as time went by, I got criticized for the way I grew up, for who I was, for talking, for not being deaf enough. It finally got to the point where I walked away from the community.", "And as we found out, this is still a divisive issue in the deaf community. Diana Harron(ph), a listener in California, e-mailed to complain. People are obsessed with fitting deaf children into the hearing lifestyle because they say it is reality and in the process deprive many deaf children of the opportunity to learn language and become fully functioning individuals in their own rights.

Bernie Sanders and former Gov. Martin O'Malley debate Sunday in Charleston, S.C. The Democratic race has is close between Clinton and Sanders.", "utt": ["The Democratic candidates for president will face off tonight. It is their last debate before voters in Iowa and New Hampshire have their say, and things have gotten interesting. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has pulled neck-and-neck with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the polls in Iowa, and he holds a significant lead in New Hampshire. Their debate tonight takes place in another important early primary state, South Carolina. NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is in Charleston, S.C., and she's with us now. Hi, Mara.", "Hi, Michel.", "So last week, Bernie Sanders was asked about the state of the race. And he said, quote, \"it could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic nomination may not be so inevitable,\" unquote. So just how vulnerable is Hillary Clinton right now?", "Well, she's vulnerable. The big question is whether her lead is actually evaporating, or is she just getting the scare of her life. You know, her campaign was prepared to lose New Hampshire. Bernie Sanders is from Vermont, and neighboring state politicians usually win there. But Iowa - losing Iowa would be a painful deja vu for her because she came in third there in 2008. And it turns out that the base of the Democratic Party like Sanders' anti-Wall Street message, which is directed against her ties to Wall Street. And recently, Sanders has been getting some help from Republicans, who would much prefer to run against him. The American Crossroads Republican superPAC has an ad blasting Hillary Clinton for taking money from Wall Street. So Sanders seems more authentic than she does. His promise to lead a political revolution is a little more inspiring than her promise to be a progressive that get things done. And, you know, Michel, there's one other irony here. Hillary Clinton had seemed to solidify her lead after the first couple of debates. But there have been so few Democratic debates - which, of course, her campaign thought was a good idea in the beginning - that it's left her without the opportunities to shine in a forum she is really good at.", "You know, there's been a lot of talk about the sort of Republican establishment and what they're going to do about how they feel about the two frontrunners at the moment, Donald and Ted Cruz. What about on the Democratic side, the establishment? What are they saying and talking about with this Bernie Sanders surge?", "It's really similar. It's just like the Republican elites and Donald Trump. Democrats in Washington think that if Sanders is the nominee, they would lose the White House. He would hurt the party down-ballot, wreck their chances of regaining the Senate. And, you know, the stakes are so much higher for Democrats this fall than Republicans because without the White House, they're in the minority almost everywhere - in the Senate, the House, the governor's mansion, state legislatures. Right now, Democrats have fewer elected officials nationally than at any time since the 1920s. So the other thing is the Democrats in Washington don't support Sanders' agenda. He wants to replace Obamacare with single-payer, Medicare for all. He wants to make public college free - not just debt-free, as Hillary Clinton proposes. And he wants to break up the big banks. That's not even part of the congressional Democratic agenda. Democrats don't even think a Democratic president could pass it.", "So we mentioned that you were in South Carolina for the debate. And it is a critical early primary state. How does that location play into what we've just been talking about now? Is the location seen to benefit either Clinton or Sanders?", "It definitely benefits Clinton. She has what her campaign considers a firewall in the South because of the large base of African-American voters. She is ahead in the polls there. But Jim Clyburn, who's the dean of the South Carolina Democratic delegation - he held his annual fish fry last night - he says that if Sanders gets big victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, that could change the dynamic in the South. Now, he is setting the bar high for Sanders. He says little victories wouldn't do it. But the big question is whether the firewall would disintegrate if Sanders wins one or both of the early states. No matter what happens, the Sanders campaign says they are very confident they can raise the money and build an organization if he can do well in the early states. So Sanders can go the distance, especially if he gets a catapult in Iowa.", "That's NPR's Mara Liasson, awaiting tonight's Democratic presidential debate in Charleston, S.C.

And so I've had the ability, I guess, within a firm to experience multiple cultures and I think that's of pretty substantial benefit to me, I think, in terms of understanding how different businesses can be run.", "Not a single business culture that has governed GM all these years?", "The culture of GM is interesting having again worked in all the different parts of General Motors, there are common threads - things like integrity, what our people stand for - there are common threads to the GM culture. But there are distinct differences based on the operations and always have been.", "In this country, GM is currently selling I guess something around 20 percent of the new cars in an economy that's so bad that people are only buying at the rate of, we guess eight or nine million new vehicles a year.", "We do sell one in five cars in general in the United States. And the market has been running at about nine and half to nine point six million unit annualized rate if you will.", "Let's say that the market recovers, not up to where it was headed - up toward 16 million vehicles - but say 12 million new vehicles a year. Can GM survive and be profitable at one fifth of that?", "The answer is yes. We are structuring the business to lower our break-even level here in North America to a U.S. market - about 10 million units. And this would be measured on an event basis, earnings before interest and taxes. Given the de-leveraging, our balance sheet will have a fairly modest interest burden for the company. And so the objective is at a 12 million unit market to be able to operate at better than break-even and generate a small profit and obviously significantly reduce the amount of cash burn that we have experienced over the last several years.", "Let me ask about the Chevy Volt, the plug-in electric car that's really only - it's a little more than a year away from launch now. It's touted in some quarters as GM's iPod, the product that can turn the whole company around. How much will the Chevy Volt cost when people get a chance to buy one?", "First of all, no single product can turn General Motors around. Every one of our products has to succeed for us to win. But let's talk about that, that's always been my philosophy that continues I think to this day.", "Mm-hmm.", "I think a Volt is as much about a demonstration of what General Motors men and women are capable of doing. I remember when it was first announced, there was widespread disbelief that lithium ion batteries could be the technology. Now, lithium ion batteries are viewed as quite a capable technology. There were a lot of skeptics, but I think we'll prove that the vehicle works, can deliver what the consumer is looking for and just be a technological statement for General Motors in terms of cost, its first generation cost, which generally is quite high. And so the objective of any first generation program is to get learnings to get to the second generation.", "But first generation is quite high. Does that mean that you're going to market this plug-in car that needs virtually no gasoline, or hardly any, for $40,000? Can you get it down to 30? Your predecessor Rick Wagoner told me at the auto show that he couldn't get it down to 30,000 without serious government subsidy.", "Well, let me - let me just start, first of all the cost. Yeah, Ricks talked about 40,000. Bob Lutz - we've talked about it in that range. There is a $7,500 tax credit that's available for that car, not just for our car but for other cars in that category. So I mean that would help defray the cost to the consumer. In the end, when we launch the vehicle, we'll launch the vehicle properly. We'll price it properly. But the cost of the vehicle is relatively high. But nonetheless, as we said we knew that going in…", "Right.", "…this is not a surprise to us. And our objective is to actually get the learnings and get to the second generation.", "But is it a car that's going to hit the market competitive with say a Prius, a successful energy saving car by cost, or is it going to be a choice you make if you're not going to buy a Lexus this year?", "Well, the - well, first of all it's a Chevrolet Volt. And so, I mean in that sense what we've chosen to do is put our foremost technology into our broadest, deepest and most important volume brand. So I think that's why we chose Chevrolet to launch the vehicle. I think the key here is, obviously, get the vehicle launch, prove ourselves. There is, you know, there is a broad category and a broad following for the vehicle that we expect to be able to be the first buyers of the vehicle. We'll have to see.", "I'm just curious, finally, since GM has been hit both by a very dire recession that has hurt every carmaker, on the other hand, GM has also gone from a majority of the cars sold in the U.S. to about a fifth of them in almost the same time that you've been working for the company over that time. How do you in your mind balance the - what's happened here and what led to Chapter 11 between factors in the American economy that have been bad news for a big old company with a big labor contract and things unique to the way that GM has managed its position in the U.S. car market?", "Well, I've had 25 years in the company working and I've spent time working in staffs and GMAC, again, all over the world. So I've had the, I guess, the benefit of that experience and seeing what's happened in different markets, seeing volatility and then obviously experiencing what we've experienced it the last two years here in the U.S.,. No one would have ever foreseen a U.S. market, for example, running at nine and half million units, certainly it was never in our planning horizon, nor anybody else's that I could see. So, you know I think we need…", "But we did see GM though losing share of the market.", "Yeah. I would say a couple of things. One, we've made mistakes. There's no question we've made mistakes. We need to learn from those mistakes and we will. I think we have - our products are the best they've ever been. And we're going to be a company that's focused around the customer.", "Well, thanks a lot for talking with us.", "My pleasure.", "That's Fritz Henderson who is the CEO of General Motors.

So what's going on here? David Wessel is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution. Good morning, David.", "Good morning, Steve.", "So what's driving the interest rate hike?", "Well, basically, the economy is doing very well. The Fed officials have kept interest rates extraordinarily low. They've put their foot on the gas pedal for a quite a while now. With inflation now creeping up to their 2 percent target, unemployment at an 18-year low of 3.9 percent and headed down, they don't think the economy any longer needs this extraordinarily low interest rates. So they're pulling their foot off the gas pedal. They're not yet touching the brake, but some Fed officials are saying it's time to touch the brake.", "Well, a couple of things here. One, we discussed how inflation has gotten to the point - still pretty low, but - gotten to the point where it's eating the average person's wages, right? Wage hikes.", "Right. So wages, on average, are only now slightly above inflation. A lot of workers seem to be getting bonuses rather than wages. But that's not beginning to compensate for all the years at which wages have risen much more slowly for the average person than inflation. In fact, the Census Bureau recently said that the typical man who worked full-time last year earned less adjusted for inflation than his counterpart did in 1999...", "Wow.", "...Using the official inflation measure.", "And yet we're at this point where they need to squeeze the economy a little bit. Do President Trump's tariffs, which are beginning to hit soon, factor into this? Because these are tariffs on just about everything, ultimately, that the United States buys from China. Does that raise prices enough that the Fed has to consider that part of inflation?", "Well, the Fed doesn't have to worry much about President Trump's tariffs in the short-run. After all, they haven't had that much effect on the overall economy, just on some pockets. The United States still produces most of what it consumes and consumes most of what it produces. But over time, the Fed does have to worry, will the tariffs slow the economy so they stop raising interest rates so much, or will they add to inflation, as you suggest, and force them to raise interest rates more rapidly than they've planned?", "One other thing I'd like to ask about, David Wessel. Interest rates went down around the time of the financial crisis. They were down around zero, effectively, for a very long time. And by now, we have a whole generation of consumers that effectively has no experience with high-interest rates, no experience with high inflation. What's it mean now that we're heading into a new phase?", "Well, I don't think they have to worry about high inflation. We're nowhere near that. But you're absolutely right on the interest rates. This is a group of people, people in their 20s and 30s, who seem to have a lot of debt. And for a lot of them, whether it's a car loan or an adjustable rate mortgage or, in some cases, student loans, the interest rate on their loans has been relatively low. It's going to start going up. That's going to pinch. On the other hand, some people who have savings may enjoy the fact that the bank's finally going to start paying them more than nothing on their savings.", "(Laughter) Which has been the experience for a lot of people. But you're saying that the really low car loan or the really low house loan, that's going to get a little harder?", "Absolutely.

There's no real set of standards that a moat must be so wide or a fence must be so tall. So they go into their network and interact with different zoos and see what barriers are the best, what distances are the best. And from my experience again with tigers in captivity, those barrier heights, those barrier widths are within the parameters for Sumatran or Siberian tigers.", "What sort of training do zookeepers have to respond to a situation like this when an animal gets out?", "Well, animal keepers in accredited facilities are going to get crisis management training. When animals escape, there'll be immediate contact with the crisis team which will start to assemble a response. Now whether that response is veterinary response to anesthetize the animal or a stronger response to put the animal down - it depends upon circumstances. And keepers should be trained to basically react by instinct because every decision obviously is critical, and you're only going to get to make a few of those decisions to try and control that or divert that situation.", "There has been quite a few incidents over the past few years at zoos, with animals escaping and doing harm. Earlier this year, at the Denver Zoo, a zookeeper was fatally attacked by a jaguar.

They have a passion for the profession. And I do not believe there would be any second thoughts about the profession at all. But I do think that there's going to be a lot of thought put into the safety aspect of the job and whether it be zoo-keeping or construction or whatever, sometimes we push safety to the back of our minds and concentrating on what we would call the exciting aspects of the job.

One of the things I wanted to talk about--obviously,      so many people paying attention to the legacy and the wonderful life of      Rosa Parks over the last few days.  I'm here in Detroit, and her body is      being viewed today and will be funeralized on tomorrow in the Motor City,      where she lived since 1957, we should note.  But one of the things we      found interesting: Mary Mitchell, who's been a guest on our Roundtable,      columnist of the Chicago Sun-Times, wrote a column suggesting that      perhaps black America didn't pay enough attention to Rosa Parks while she      was alive, and while all of us praised what she did and gloried in the      bravery and the outcome of what she started, some suggest, because she      lived a fairly meager lifestyle here in Detroit, that perhaps we didn't      do what we needed to as a community.  The inference is that she should      have been set up better economically, that we should have perhaps as a      community bought a home and had all of the things that are day-to-day      necessities taken care of for her.", "The same thing has been raised, quite frankly, about Mrs. King.  While      that family has done fairly well, they are by no means rich.  Certainly      Mrs. King is not.  When we look at George Lucas donating a million      dollars for a proposed statue of Martin Luther King on the Mall, one has      to question whether or not African-Americans are doing all they should      for our icons.  Glenn Loury, when you hear that suggestion--and I should      note that you never know what people will say privately.  I knew Mrs.      Parks.  She was a wonderful woman and was a humble woman.  We don't know      what was offered to her privately and may have been turned down.  But      that being said, should our community be doing more for our icons?", "Well, I read the piece in the      Sun-Times, and it is disturbing.  On the other hand, I'm also a little      disturbed by the framing of this conversation, because Rosa Parks was an      American icon.  She was not only an African-American icon.  At one level,      I want to say yes, more should have been done, and it's horrid to imagine      her staying in some apartment and being on the verge of eviction and      having to go from one day to the next not knowing where the money was      coming from.  On the other hand, I want to say it's not only the black      community's responsibility to honor a woman who helped to lead this      nation out of the darkness of apartheid, this nation, which has many rich      people and which has many more people than blacks.  So I'm of two minds      about it.", "Hm.  Tara?", "Well, I think it's      interesting, because we in the black community were so quick to circle      the wagons around our own during certain debates, but in a situation like      this, why that didn't happen with someone as wonderful as Rosa Parks, who      was such a pioneer, who--her contribution to our community is      immeasurable, and yet she did live such a meager life.  I think it's--it      concerns me, but at the same time, I agree with the professor that I am      of two minds with this.  She was not only a hero in our community, she      was an American hero, which is why she laid in honor in the Capitol, the      first woman to ever have that honor.  So I think it raises an interesting      debate about whether--when is it appropriate for us to make sure our own      are taken care of, and why that hasn't happened.  I think that's an      interesting discussion.", "Jeff, I want to take it away from Rosa Parks, because you can      get too tied in to her situation, and again, we don't know what she      suggested privately.  I know for certain there were things that were      offered and later on in life done for her by the dignitaries and others      here in the city of Detroit.  But that being said, let's take a look at      the idea of iconic figures and what is due--again, we most notably heard      recently George Lucas suggesting he's going to put up a million dollars      for the long-proposed statue of Martin Luther King on the Mall.", "Yes.", "We have heard throughout history, quite frankly, whether or not      we here in the African-American community are doing enough, quote, \"for      our own.\"", "Yeah, well, you know, there's something to be said in this      whole discussion about the notion that we--the poem that we always hear      at funerals. `Give us our flowers while we yet live.'

And I was      a little shy about it, but I ended up going out there and Mom ended up      showing me up, and that was the highlight of the show.  And I thought      about all of the kids in the neighborhood and all the kids at the schools      that I went to that my Mom assisted and gave rides home to and looked      after, and although there was a communal responsibility to pay that back,      it was my responsibility, and it's my responsibility to take care of my      mom, because she's in my household.  So I think that whether the      mainstream buys into taking care of Rosa Parks or not, we have a      spiritual responsibility as a people to look after our own, first and      foremost, and then if anything else gets heaped on top of it, that's      great, too.", "We think of iconic figures in our community.  I say that we do have a      responsibility to take care of people, only because we demonstrate it in      other ways.  How many people go to a church where the pastor is taken      care of in a house, a big car and nice clothes?  We have these huge      figures that are supported by African-American congregations in our      community, and they are taken care of and are very, very wealthy.  But      here's a woman who stood up and sacrificed herself for the lives of,      yeah, sure, every American, but by and large it was African-Americans who      were being discriminated against, and she put her life and her welfare on      the line.  I think it's a shame that we didn't step up and do more for      her.", "We should note, too, that a woman who spoke at the ceremonies in      Washington yesterday, Oprah Winfrey, when talking about giving people      their salutes while they're still alive, their flowers, if you will, Ms.      Winfrey has done quite a bit in moving that case, including assisting      Mrs. King at times.  And certainly, during her Legends Ball, which I had      the pleasure of attending, she did, in fact, salute many icons of our      community.", "We move our attention now to something that's very interesting, and      again, it goes back to a question of how black America looks and deals      with itself, and that is a blogger, a liberal blogger, we should note,      posted a doctored photograph of Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele in      minstrel makeup.  Steele, of course, is running for the Senate seat      in--the Republican Senate seat in Maryland, and we should suggest that      the blogger said that he did this because Steele did not, in fact, step      out and denounce his, as he called it, `political partner'--that's the      governor of Maryland--who held a fund-raiser this year at a country club      that has never admitted a black member in its 127-year history.  And we      talked about that, in fact, when that went on, on the Roundtable.", "The question here is, here's Michael Steele, a Republican, someone who      has, in fact, had a long career, often has been ridiculed by black      America, quite frankly, called an Uncle Tom.  He even talked about how      Democrats, during a 2002 debate, tossed Oreo cookies at him.  We don't      have to explain that, for those who know, know.  So that being said,      Tara, when you look at this kind of thing that goes on in 2005--and I      know you yourself, being a Republican strategist, have faced the question      of whether or not you are really dealing with issues that are of import      to black America.", "Well, just to address myself personally, that has been one      of the focuses of my career, that I make sure as a Republican that      we--when I'm called upon to discuss strategy, that we do focus on those      issues, and that we make sure that we establish relationships and      rapport.  That has been the frustration I've had with the national party      over these some years, that sometimes they just don't get that.", "But there are plenty of individuals like Michael Steele who do get it,      and this is an individual who does not deserve the title of being an      Uncle Tom or being ridiculed to the point of--it disgusts me, because      here's a man who lived the American Dream, who grew up--his mother      adopted him.  She worked minimum-wage jobs her entire life to send him to      private school, never took a dime of public assistance.  He chose to go      into ministry--he was in seminary school for some time--and he is--and      for him to be painted as a minstrel, as a mouthpiece or be called a      puppet master, like Julian Bond referred to all--to black Republicans, it      takes away from the discourse that we need to have about real issues.      And it--and unfortunately, when you let--when you throw bombs like      this--Aaron McGruder did the same thing last year in his cartoon, The      Boondocks, where he disrespected Condoleezza Rice, and he called her a      murderer on \"America's Black Forum\" when he was a panelist with me.  I      was there.  I witnessed it.  And that type of language does us no good.      It takes away from the healthy debate we should be having about issues      that affect our communities.", "Can I get in here just to say this?  I don't know Michael      White--I'm sorry, Michael Steele.  I'm sure he's a very fine man.      But--and the but here is that, in my view, the issue is how the authority      of the experience of African-Americans in this country gets used, gets      deployed in our current politics, because when a person, man or woman,      stands up and is black, and is to some degree, by a Republican president,      let's say, advertised as black, it is said, `See?  I'm this kind of      president because I have black people near me.'  That's a deploying of      the moral authority of the experience of African-Americans.  Now if the      policies of the administration with which that person is associated cut      against the interest and the moral witness of African-Americans, as I      believe clearly the policies of this Bush administration do, then it's      fair enough to point out, `Hey, you're using blackness in order to      counter black Americans' interest,' just like President George Bush the      first did when he appointed Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court.  It's      no ad hominem against Thomas to say that that was a cynical, manipulative      use of the history of African-Americans in order to pursue a right-wing      agenda, and that's what's at stake here.", "Jeff, let me ask you...", "Do you honestly believe there's not ad hominem attack      involved here?  It's absolutely an ad hominem attack.", "No, no, no, no.  I'm saying people have engaged in ad      hominem attack.", "OK.", "But what I'm saying is, it's a fair question to say, `Hey,      you're standing up telling everybody you're black, but you're associated      with a government that is hell-bent on countering the interests of black      people.' That's a fair argument to make about somebody.", "That's a discussion for another day.", "Jeff, let me ask you this as relates to the idea of      name-calling, the idea of placing an Uncle Tom tag on someone, the      minstrel white-face on someone.  Black America, to a great degree, still      is stinging politically by all of what we've had to face throughout the      years, and there is, while we don't want to paint ourselves with a      monolithic brush, there seems to be, to a great degree, if just political      affiliation is to be believed, a certain monolith politically within our      community.  If you are against the grain, you are often, quite frankly,      particularly in private, called some of these names, sometimes in jest,      sometimes in fun.  But there is a sense of you just don't get it.  You      just aren't black enough, as Billy Paul would ask the question musically.", "Right, exactly.  I think we do--as a people in this country      right now, I think we do try to hold on to what small dignity we have,      and at least some kind of collective notion of collective consciousness,      and because of that, we look for opportunities to find pride in      accomplishment of African-Americans.  We look at people like Tiger Woods,      we look at sports figures like the Williams sisters and we look at people      who become icons for us even politically, and we look for them as a      source of pride.  We still have the notion that if a person is considered      a first, even in the year 2005, then they are something to be proud of.      It's the first secretary of State, it's the first person to win this many      golf tournaments, etc.  And then when they do something that we feel does      not support our community, whether that's dating a white woman or hanging      around with a party that most black people have not been attached to in      recent years, good or bad, right or wrong, we see that as a violation of      the trust.  And so the words do come out, and it's Uncle Tom.", "And that's what I struggle with sometimes, because I think the remark was      made that it's an unfair designation.  I've not known of one person that      has been considered an Uncle Tom by any group of people that has      righteously stood up and admitted, `Yes, you're right.  I am an Uncle      Tom.'  So I don't think anybody has been proud of that title.  But this      is America.  Now either we have a right to express ourselves freely or      not.", "But the...", "Gilliard's blog, I didn't get to see the image.  I went to see      it and it was already gone.  They changed the picture.  But it wasn't      politically correct.  But isn't that what a lot of people, including      people on both sides, Democrats and Republicans, claim to want?  They      want honesty and straightforwardness and people to be able to express      themselves.  You can't have it both ways.", "Well, which comes first?  Which comes first, the racial pride or      the political fervor?  Because let's be honest; one would believe, if      Condoleezza Rice, who was the first African-American secretary of      State--had she been Democrat and perhaps a little bit further left than      right, she would be, quite frankly, more embraced publicly by      African-Americans.", "Absolutely.", "Yeah.  I think it's...", "Yeah, but...", "I think it's safer--yeah, you could say that's safer because      that--but that's partly to blame because African-Americans sit on their      laurels and just kind of let the Democratic Party get away with whatever      they want to.  The Democratic Party does take them for granted, and we      just kind of act in our own way.  What I'd like to think is possible is      that African-Americans can start to judge people as individuals and look      beyond these party affiliations and see who's going to be on our side,      and who, quite frankly, would be an Uncle Tom or an Oreo.", "And, Glenn, to a great degree that's what you were saying in the      sense of looking at where they stand politically.  Perhaps the      African-American community has, in fact, done that with Condoleezza Rice      and looked at--deciphered where she stands politically.", "Precisely.  I would say, you know, civility first, OK?  The      way we should talk to each other, with each other, about each other in      our politics ought to be civil and respecting the person.  But these are      hard issues.  Republicans, Karl Rovians, violate the civility constraint      every bit as much as Democrats do.  These are hard issues, so we have to      decide as a group of people, African-Americans, do we have interests?      And if we have interests, we have to have ways of policing ourselves, of      holding each other to account, around those interests.  Let a Jewish      financier stand up and start giving money to the Palestinian Liberation      Organization and start talking about how the state of Israel is      oppressing people on the West Bank, and see what happens to him within      his community.", "Oh...", "They have interests, they know what they are and they      enforce them.", "Tara, you're literally--I got...", "There is...", "That's all I'm talking about here.  Holding...", "There is absolutely no...", "Hold people accountable for what they do.", "Tara...", "Hold them accountable for what they do.", "Tara, you got 30 seconds.", "You can hold people accountable, and I'm in full agreement      of that, but to compare the Republican Party and a black conservative to      a Jewish individual giving money to the Palestinians, who want to see the      Jewish state eradicated off the planet, is just irresponsible.  And you      know, Michael Steele, who--he was president of the NAACP chapter in      Prince George's County.", "Real quick, Tara.", "He's fought for access for women and minority businesses      and contracts in Maryland.", "All right.", "He is absolutely fostering the interest of blacks in      Maryland.", "All right.  Let me note this, and I apologize, Tara, I got to      stop you there.", "That's OK.", "But we have invited Michael Steele on the program and we are      hoping in the next week to have him on.  I hope he will accept the      invitation.  And Michael, if you're listening I'm going to call the      office, in fact, myself this week.  So we hope to have him on next week.", "All right.

The university wants to partner with the company Waste Management, to use a byproduct of decomposing trash to help heat and light its campus.", "New Hampshire Public Radio's Any Quinton reports.", "Most of the turnkey landfill in Rochester, New Hampshire could easily pass for the grassy green hills of Ireland. It's hard to believe that more than a million tons of garbage is send here every year.", "The pipes sticking out, you see are the lamp of gas wells, and all those supposed are 36-inch holes drilled onto the waste.", "Waste Management owns this site. District manager Alan Davis walks down from the top of the landfill toward where captured methane gas is burning.", "If you could see the flares burning. There's three flares are currently there. There's two, what we call the utility candle flares on the right, and those are ones that are - just look like a big, big lighter almost.", "Methane is a byproduct of decomposing garbage. It's also a greenhouse gas, which is why Waste Management burns it before it hits the atmosphere. But this gas is also a powerful energy source. Waste Management is already using methane from other landfills across the country to provide energy for Fortune 500 companies such as Nestle, BMW and GM. Alan Davis thought the biggest energy user next to turnkey the University of New Hampshire can also benefit from this technology.", "The plan is those flares will be burned up once the university project comes in, and instead that gases just being wasted on those flares will be going to their project.", "UNH trustees have given conceptual approval to build a 12 and-a-half mile pipeline to route the gas from this landfill to the campus. But it's not an easy or cheap process. Allan Braun is lead consultant for the project.", "That's a great opportunity, to be able to use a renewable fuel, but the challenges are pretty significant. One, landfill gas is full of contaminants that you would have to remove. Two, is that it has a low heat content, we measure that in British thermal units or BTUs. It's about half of what natural gas out of a pipeline would be.", "The university would have to build not only a pipeline, but also a processing plant to clean and raise the gases' BTU content. In total, the project would cost UNH around $33 million. Waste Management's Alan Davis says it took some persuading to get UNH to consider it.", "One you convince them that's - it can be done. It's already being done, it isn't brand new technology, and that also that there's going to be enough gas for a long time. A lot of people look at the capital investment, which is very high for something like this, and I worry that it isn't going to last long enough.", "Davis says landfills can continue to produce methane up to 20 or 30 years after their close and capped. UNH already spends about $ 12.5 million a year for heat and electricity, a cost that increases every year. Other universities such as UCLA have used methane gas from landfills to help fuel their campuses. But UNH Office of Sustainability director Tom Kelly says this project would meet 85 percent of the campuses energy needs, larger than any other university.", "And in fact, part of the importance, I think of our whole approach is that it's really exploding the myth that you have to choose between the economy and the environment so to speak.", "More importantly, Kelly says the project could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from five metric tons of carbon dioxide per person to only one.

In it, he spoke about Russia, about NATO, about bigger ideas about the U.S. role in the world.", "Russia's leadership is challenging truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self evident, that in the 21st century the borders of Europe cannot be redrawn with force.", "David, over the last few weeks we talked quite a bit about Vladimir Putin and speeches he gave. What did you make of these comments from President Obama?", "Well, he understands the problem. That's a very good encapsulation of what we're facing here, that Putin really does threaten what's left of the post-Cold War era where we don't have spheres of influence, where countries don't bend the borders of others, and so he really did a very nice job of asserting that point.", "And they have ratcheted up the sanctions pretty well. If I would fault him, it would be on two things. One, they're not hitting Putin and his inner circle hard enough with the sanctions, and second, the president has been too quick to take all military deterrents off the table, even to the extent of arming the Ukrainians, whatever it would be. He said military deterrence does not work. But, of course, military deterrence does work, especially if the Russians amass troops on the Ukrainian border.", "E.J.", "Well, just on that point, it's clear that we have a commitment to defending NATO and he was right. He said it explicitly that he didn't want to make a promise that we couldn't keep, and I don't think anybody believes we would send troops to Ukraine. But there is an upside to this crisis that we saw this week in the president's speech.", "Relations with Europe had kind of frayed. They weren't terrible and President Obama's still quite popular in Europe, but there's been a feeling throughout his administration that he didn't care very much about Europe or think very much about them. And this speech was a very strong assertion of our common values, our common interests.", "He took some pokes at Putin. Instead of targeting our gay brothers and sisters, he said, we can use our laws, meaning the West, to protect their rights. The Financial Times had a good editorial suggesting this may actually, Putin's actions may be a very good thing for the Western alliance, and I think that may turn out to be the case.", "I want to mention one more noted meeting and that was between the president and the pope. You know, the White House said their conversation was about inequality and the poor. The Vatican had these kind of veiled comments about - that seemed to be read as a commentary on abortion and contraception. E.J.?", "What seems to have happened is the Vatican always is deferential to local bishops and so they were going to bring that up somehow. What the president said, and I understand this is the case, that this was brought up by the Vatican secretary of state and that the talk with the pope himself focused much more on the economic and the social justice issues that they had in common.", "I think in American terms what may have some real impact is their talk about immigration. And the pope is very committed to immigrants and refugees, and I think you may see some more ratcheting up of Catholic support, which is already strong for immigration reform.", "David, a wide-ranging talk with a very popular cultural figure in the world right now. What did you make of the president's meeting?", "Yeah, I wish he had treated the pope as the pope - that is to say, not exchanging a series of banal talking points as if they were some global summit between national leaders, but treat the pope as a spiritual personality and take it as an opportunity, first to learn how the pope has really changed the narrative of the Catholic Church by going back to the beatitudes, going back to the basics, and really, as a style of leadership I think the pope has a lot to offer any world leader.", "And secondly, I always want the president to go in and say - for personal counseling. Here's a deeply spiritual man, deeply skilled at personal counseling. I'm a world leader. How am I not corrupted by this kind sort of power? How do I lead my life? I always think that's how you should treat the pope, not as a national figure.", "E.J., I see you jumping in here.", "Well, first of all, the pope is an important political figure whether you like it or not, and second - and I'm not saying David dislikes it - but the second is, I think Obama did do a little of that. We don't know what they actually said, but at the end of their visit, the pope gave him his letter - his apostolic exhortation, \"The Joy of the Gospel.\" That is a very serious document and a spiritual document and Obama said he would turn to it when he was down.", "And so I think he may have gotten a little of that pastoral counseling that David hopes he got.", "Well, I want to turn now to some domestic politics. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, yesterday, his office released results of an internal investigation that essentially cleared the governor of wrongdoing in connection with the lane closures on the George Washington Bridge last year. Now, today Christie announced that another of his top allies is resigning and I want to talk to you guys about this.", "But let's get more detail from NPR's Joel Rose. He has the latest on this story. Stay where you are.", "The Christie administration's internal investigation was billed as objective and thorough, but critics say it's neither. Today, Governor Christie faced a skeptical press corps in Trenton and tried to downplay concerns about the report.", "We gave them unfettered, complete access to everyone in this government, and allowed them to interview people multiple times if they so desired, on multiple occasions, in order to try to get to the bottom of things.", "Christie says the report confirms that he had nothing to do with the plan to close the lanes. Investigators did not get to interview some key players in the scandal, including David Samson, he's a mentor to Governor Christie, and he was the governor's top appointee at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the Gorge Washington bridge, until today, when Christie announces Samson's resignation.", "He believes that the best way to start a new year at the Port Authority is with new leadership. In line with that belief, David tendered his resignation to me this afternoon, effective immediately.", "Christie says Samson's resignation had been in the works for a year, but internal Port Authority email suggests that Samson knew about the lane closures while they were happening. The internal investigation puts the blame squarely on former Christie staffers and appointees who have since resigned or been fired, but it does not offer any explanation as to why the lanes were closed in the first place. For that we may have to wait for separate investigations by the U.S. attorney for New Jersey and the state legislature to play out. Joel Rose, NPR News.", "And back to our political observers David Brooks and E.J. Dionne. David, I'm going to let you start here. We hear the governor, you know, defending this independent review, but these resignations, do they help, or is this a sign of more bad news?", "Well, I think there's - this doesn't clear him. It was an internal review. We've got two other reviews, which will have more credibility. But I think it seems unlikely there's a smoking gun. There's probably not an email sitting out there to prove that Christie knew about what was going on. I can't imagine the law firm would've buried that.", "Having watched Governor Christie perform in front of some Republican donors groups, though, I will say I'm struck by how little they care about this. The questions are never on this; they're on other national issues. So I'm not sure it'll hurt him as much in the Republican primary field, to the extent that we care about that, as much as some people think.", "Well so far this has hurt him if you look at the polls not only in the general population, the general public, but also among Republicans. And I'm not sure this report will - it may have hurt more than it helps because a million taxpayer dollars went into this. The New York Times editorialized that it was an expensive whitewash. It really reads much more like a brief for Christie than it does like an investigation.", "And there's one thing they did in there that I think is going to offend a lot of people. The two key figures in this whom they didn't interview, Bridget Kelly, a top aide to Governor Christie, and Bill Stepien, the report talked about a relationship they had, a personal relationship. And they brought it up again and again. I don't think most voters or citizens like bringing up personal relationships in the context of this. There was no predicate for why it was in there.", "So I think that David's right for there are a lot of Republicans who won't care about it, but I think this is going to hang around for a while. You could hear Christie in his news conference hoping this would draw a line under the thing, but I'm not - I don't think it will.", "Yes, David, you're saying this now, but we've got two more investigations to go, right?", "Right. But the fact is we still don't have evidence that he did know.

It's a true      story, though the names in it are not.  He's called Joey O'Shay.      Undercover cops face obvious dangers to life and limb and, as Joey      discovers, less obvious ones to the soul.  Toward good ends--winning the      drug war--they lie, deceive and betray.

They were even willing to do huge jail      sentences--in other words, give up their entire life so that their      families didn't live in abject poverty; that their families could have      things that they didn't have.", "Joey O'Shay was so good at undercover that often, if he wasn't      on the actual arrest raid, the people who got caught never understood      that he was a cop.  They thought he'd simply gotten away.  And some of      them would refuse to offer Joey's name to the narcs, protecting him.      That's what Joey finally could no longer live with--their refusal to      betray him, especially a cocaine and heroin broker, Gloria.", "What was your relationship with Gloria?", "Mr. O'SHAY:  Nothing but admiring her because she had survived in a      extremely violent man's world and did what she did to support her kids      and grandkids.

There was no romance or anything like      that, but in this business, a woman, for business purposes, is willing to      give their body up as collateral, I guess you might say.

The      quality is higher than it's ever been.  And the price is going down.  So,      I mean, it's not working the way it's been going.  There's too much      politics involved. They cannot shut the border down.  They won't shut the      border down.  And we consume the majority of it that's being sold.

So what are we trying to accomplish?", "See, we've seen a lot of people get hurt, get shot, lose their jobs      fighting this drug war.  And, you know, I gave all I could give, and I      know he gave all he could give.  We don't have anything else to give.      The only alternative that makes any sense to me is to legalize it.

Good morning.", "Good morning, Renee.", "Now, the Good Friday Peace Agreement was signed back in 1998, after -just after this bombing I was talking about earlier. The IRA renounced violence at that time. So, who is planting a 400-pound bomb now and why?", "Well, the police in Northern Ireland believe that it is so-called dissident Republican groups. The Republicans are, of course, the people who want Northern Ireland to be united with the rest of Ireland. The Loyalists are the people who want Northern Ireland to remain part of Britain. And these dissident Republican groups opposed the IRA giving up their arms. They opposed the Irish Republican Army's deal that it did with the British government and with the loyalist groups in Northern Ireland. There were people at the fringes of the IRA who did not agree with that, who wanted to continue with the fight for an immediate united Ireland, and those are the groups who have carried on this low-level of shootings and bombings that have plagued Northern Ireland -not at a really massive level over the last decade, but it's always there. There's a sort of low growl of dissident IRA activity.", "Although, it must seem - I mean, a 400-pound bomb sounds like it could do a awfully lot of damage. I mean, how many people are we talking about? How much popular support do they have? And it sounds like they might be attempting bigger attacks.", "That's right. This is a huge bomb, by any standards. I think the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland are behind the peace agreement. Most people have had enough of violence. I think we're talking of a hardcore dozens of people here, rather than hundreds. But it should be said that after decades - centuries, almost - of animosity, you can't get rid of that animosity overnight. So, although the different communities and many people in them do support the peace agreement and do support the cessation of - by most people -of violence, the hostility, the low-level lack of trust, if you like, in the different communities is still very much there. I was there quite recently, and you could still feel it. There was - of course, in the different Republican and Loyalist communities, it's not going away. It's going to take probably a whole generation or two before that really goes away.", "So, the current state, then, of the peace process, how is it working on the ground?", "Well, it has not been a completely smooth path, as you would expect, after what has happened over the years in Northern Ireland. But we do have a power sharing agreement between former enemies, and that in itself is extraordinary when you look at the people who have entered into this power-sharing agreement. At the moment, there's a dispute about policing, about devolving the full control over policing and justice issues from London to Belfast, to the local government there. And that's going on, and there's lots of back and forth and there's lots of arguing. But the fact that the power-sharing agreement even exists, I think some people feel is a miracle. And so the fact that the majority of the people are behind it, despite the many, many problems that there are to iron out over the coming years is, I think, a massive step forward, and everybody feels that.", "NPR's Rob Gifford.

What      I saw and in the meetings I had with government officials was a very      strong level of openness and understanding that a business like      Starbucks, which has built itself on this balance between profitability      and benevolence, is the kind of business that they would like to see      succeed in China.  And what I mean by that specifically is that the      Chinese government is very interested, I think, in opening up their doors      to Western companies and Western brands and especially those companies      that can come and be very respectful of the heritage and the tradition of      how that country was built.", "Do you ever talk to an official, and he's quite friendly to you      and quite receptive to what you want to do, but, well, you get an uneasy      feeling about it?", "No.  I have had--I think when you enter a country like      China or, for that matter, any other country, you really have to come hat      in hand and demonstrate a willingness to understand their way of thinking      and their way of life.  And I think what we're most proud of is the      foundation that we built in China is very, very strong because the values      and guiding principles of our company are the same that they are in      America, despite the fact that we're doing business in China.", "Howard Schultz of Starbucks, thanks very much.", "Thank you for having me on."], "speaker": ["STEVE INSKEEP, host", "STEVE INSKEEP, host", "Mr. HOWARD SCHULTZ (Chairman, Starbucks)", "STEVE INSKEEP, host", "Mr. HOWARD SCHULTZ (Chairman, Starbucks)", "STEVE INSKEEP, host", "Mr. HOWARD SCHULTZ (Chairman, Starbucks)", "STEVE INSKEEP, host", "Mr. HOWARD SCHULTZ (Chairman, Starbucks)", "STEVE INSKEEP, host", "Mr. HOWARD SCHULTZ (Chairman, Starbucks)", "STEVE INSKEEP, host", "Mr. HOWARD SCHULTZ (Chairman, Starbucks)"], "snorkel_label": [-1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 4, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1]}

How hard is it for someone to get their hands on classified military information? Well, not so hard for Los Angeles Times reporter Paul Watson.", "He bought stolen U.S. military computer drives that contain classified information at an Afghan bazaar just outside the U.S.-run Bagram air base. We reached Paul Watson in Kabul earlier today.", "Paul Watson, what you found very interesting there and what you wrote about Monday are these Flash drives, little memory packets for computers about the size of a pack of chewing gum. And you were able to buy some of these that had come from the air base. And they had secret information on them.", "That's right. They have everything from social security numbers for, we counted more than 700 soldiers, all the way up to briefings for commanders on the base which are marked secret, which include maps for targeting of suspected al-Qaida and Taliban bases, both inside Afghanistan, and also what they believe to be real bases in Pakistan.", "That's also some, what I would say, is awkward or highly embarrassing information about Afghan officials that the U.S. military thinks are not trustworthy. Indeed, they think they're drug smugglers, and there are discussions of governors and chiefs of police who the American military wants out of power.", "Some of them are even suspected, by the way, of being involved in attacks against U.S. in Afghan forces. These documents make it very clear that the U.S. military and Special Forces units are directly involved in identifying officials they want removed, and in making sure that they are replaced.", "How are these drives getting off of the base and into the market?", "The shop owners tell us that they are Afghan workers, garbage collectors, cleaners, people who wash U.S. forces' clothes who are able to take these, either by pulling them out of pockets or simply yanking them out of the little USB slot on the laptops, and then concealing them in different places as they leave the base at the end of their shift.", "The piece in the paper today recounts how the American military, after your story broke on Monday, I guess yesterday they went to the market looking to see if they could buy some of these things. But the shopkeepers hid them. When the military had gone by, the shopkeepers brought these things back out and said, yes, we still have them for sale.", "And there's also a character in this story you describe, an Afghan man in his 40s who seems to be from the south, from the insurgent region, and he's looking to buy specifically these drives. He doesn't care about anything but these drives that have secret information on them.", "Well, we went back to the bazaar again today to check and also to buy some more of these, they've had recent deliveries of drives even today. So, the security leak is still a problem.", "There are now journalists out trying to buy these things. And I suspect in a country like Afghanistan, there would be intelligence agents from any number of surrounding countries, including Pakistan, Iran, Russia, probably looking for the same things.", "A U.S. military spokesman you quote says, \"We're not going to talk about operational procedures.\" But what steps is the military taking to try to control this? They've sent patrols through. What else?", "They've said absolutely nothing to me about specifically what they're doing. And just on the face of it, it doesn't look like they're doing much.", "It's deeply shocking to me that this kind of information was available in a shop, and that the shop clerk was a 16-year-old boy who had no clue what this stuff is.

Dakota Fanning, anyone?", "Well, today we honor the best and worst child performances. What youngster's gut-wrenching realism caught you by surprise?

Where bonbons play on the sunny beach of Peppermint Bay.", "Well, nobody could do cute like Shirley Temple.", "Oh, is that who that was?", "Oh, I know you'd figure out who it was.", "Yeah. She really does get pride of place here. She was one of the biggest stars in the history of the movies in America. And that's one of the things about this category, Neal. Really you're talking about - I'm sure that every stage parent or screen parent who shoves their child forth to be a star thinks that they're all going to end up like, you know, Ambassador to the United Nations. They're going to end up being a Shirley Temple.", "But the truth of the matter is some of the biggest stars did start out as kids. You know, you think of Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland and Elizabeth Taylor, you mentioned, and Natalie Wood. I mean, these are - and my personal favorite of the child stars - there is a short subject from 1933 called Rufus Jones for President which features -", "I missed that one somehow.", "You can find it on DVD. It's an amazing performance by the eight-year-old Sammy Davis, Jr.", "Really?", "Just singing and dancing up a storm.", "I think I may have seen clips of it probably in his obit, but.", "So, you know, it can lead to stardom in other ways. But there's a kind of a dictum about working with kids on the stage or the screen, which is as a director you sort of just let them go. Point them in the right direction and let them do what they do.", "But just as in certain areas - like mathematics, music, some of the other arts - there are some young people who can really, really act. And some of them have turned in some amazing performances. One of the reasons I think we're in mind of this this summer is there's a movie right now out called Little Miss Sunshine...", "Yeah.", "...which features an extraordinary performance by Abigail Breslin.", "Let's hear a clip from Little Miss Sunshine.", "(As Olive) I don't want to be a loser.", "Unidentified Man #1 (Actor): You're not a loser.

We're going to have fun tomorrow, right?", "(As Olive): Yeah.", "Yeah.", "And I'll paraphrase a bit, but that's right I think before one of my favorite lines in the movie, where Alan Arkin says to her, he says are you kidding? I love you, and it's got nothing to do with your talent or your brains.", "This is Abigail Breslin, and at our theater, the AFI Silver, we frequently have directors and filmmakers talking about their work. And the directors of the movie, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, a husband and wife team - terrific people and terrific directors - and they said she was one who really absorbed ideas and translated them through art and craft into an acting performance, and you can see it on the screen.", "Let's get some listeners involved in this conversation.", "I want to really hear what our listeners have to say about these.", "800-989-8255. E-mail is talk@npr.org. Let's begin with Jerry(ph). Jerry's calling from Cleveland, Ohio. Jerry, are you there?", "Yes I am. Hello.", "Hi, you're on the air. Go ahead, please.", "Well I - my favorite one was Margaret O'Brien, Meet Me in St. Louis. She absolutely stole the show away from Judy Garland.", "Well, it's hard to steal anything from Judy Garland, but Margaret O'Brien was awfully good.", "Yes she was. And also in the Secret Garden she was excellent.", "And the Bad Seed, let's not forget that.", "Well, that was not she. That was actually another Irish name. That was Patty McCormack.", "Oh, I'm sorry.", "In the Bad Seed.", "Oh, those Micks, I get them confused.", "You know, Margaret O'Brien, there's a famous story, which is one of those that if it's not true, it should be - but Vincente Minnelli could not get her to cry during the scene where Julie Garland sings Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.", "A great song.", "And she had been so trained by her mother to be smiling and chipper all the time that Minnelli finally said cut, went up to Margaret O'Brien and said you know your little dog Jasper? Yeah, he was just run over by a cafeteria truck outside. And she started weeping, and Minnelli said action, and that's the performance you see on the screen.", "And Judy Garland married him, didn't she?", "That's right. What a man.", "Jerry, thanks very much for the call.", "Thank you very much.", "And, of course, that's one child actress, former child - how are we defining child, Murray?", "Well thank you for asking. I think we sort of have to draw the line here at adolescence. So I mean - my staff at the AFI Silver, which helped me with this, said well you know, why don't we draw the line at puberty, which is different for some people than it is for others.", "But there are so many coming-of-age films now, especially in the last 10 or 20 years, that we have to sort of - not - you know, somebody - among those who were not maybe in the hall of fame. Somebody nominated Hilary Duff, and she was kind of a ‘tween in The Lizzie McGuire Movie. But now, of course, she's sort of a young woman, so she's off limits.", "There is a kind of - there's one coming-of-age movie performance that is so extraordinary that it deserves special mention, and that's Jean-Pierre Léaud in François Truffaut's the 400 Blows.", "And that's again a separate category.", "Right.", "Take all the awards, then give out the silver medals.", "Right.", "Here's an e-mail we got from - who is this from? Sandra(ph). Best performance by a child actor, I nominate Justin Henry who played opposite Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman in 1979's Kramer vs. Kramer and held his own. Did ever a child cry so convincingly? Worst? Well, there are just too many to choose from.", "Well it's interesting, you know. When we ask people about worst performances from a child actor, we're breaking a cardinal rule of show business, which is you never criticize anybody, particularly anybody living.", "I thought the cardinal rule of show business is never follow a dog act or a child.", "Or a kid, that's right.", "We were mentioning earlier that the immortal Elizabeth Taylor really came to prominence in the great National Velvet.", "(As Velvet Brown) Mi?", "(As Mi Taylor) Huh?", "(As Velvet Brown) Could The Pie win the Grand National?", "(As Mi Taylor) Who do you think you are?", "(As Velvet Brown) I'm the owner of The Pie", "(As Mi Taylor) And does that give you leave to think you could take the richest, grandest prize a horse ever won? Why that's for kings, and you're just a wisp of a butcher's daughter who should be playing with a dolly.", "And does that give you leave to think that you could play Puck, me lad?", "Twelve years old, Elizabeth Taylor, and it's sort of all there.

Bill's calling us from Detroit.", "Hi.", "Hi.", "I got - I don't know how great of an actor he is, but there's a scene in the movie The Champ when Ricky Schroder did The Champ with Jon Voight. At the end of the movie, when Jon Voight dies on a table, and he's saying wake up, champ, wake up, champ. A friend of mine and I saw it. We're both police officers, and were with his girlfriend, and we both cried, and she didn't do a darn thing.", "Well, Bill, I have to tell you that if you'd seen the original...", "Right.", "Jackie Coogan and...", "Well actually it's Jackie Cooper and Wallace Beery.", "And Wallace Beery, yes.", "But you mentioned the other great child star, Jackie Coogan, in the silent The Kid with Charlie Chaplin.", "And - but that scene - you're the champ.", "Right.", "What a tremendous, tremendous performance.", "And you're absolutely right about men being a sap for that. I mean, I'm getting tears welling up right now and I hate that movie. It's just great. It's just impossible.", "Bill, thanks very much for the call.", "All right, Neal, great show. Thanks very much.", "Thanks. Bye-bye. Let's go to Jen(ph). And Jen's calling from Chattanooga.", "Hi, how are you?", "Very well, thanks.", "I wish I had a name for you, but the little girl from Whale Rider.", "Yes. Actually I have her name for you - and where is she? She's right here on my list. But she was actually - it was Keisha Castle-Hughes and she was nominated for an Academy Award for Whale Rider. And that's another good point we have to mention, Neal. There are some kids on whose shoulders the whole movie rests.", "Yes.", "They're not just like incidental, they've got to carry the film.", "And that is one of them, I think.", "Yeah, I agree.", "Jen, thanks very much.", "You're welcome.", "You mentioned also that these child actors, some of these were spawning grounds for future, you know, mature actors. And well, one of those spawning grounds was that serial, The Little Rascals.", "Unidentified Child #1 (Actor): (As Alfalfa) I don't like to brag, but Butch might as well give up right now. He hasn't got a chance.", "Unidentified Child #2 (Actor): (As Darla) Oh, do you really think so?", "Unidentified Child #1: (As Alfalfa) Just wait until you see what I did to the street.", "Unidentified Child #2: (As Darla) Oh, look. Here comes Butch.", "Unidentified Child #3: (As Butch) (unintelligible)", "Unidentified Child #4 (Actor): You won't laugh when I'm mayor.", "Unidentified Child #2: (As Darla) I'm proud of what Alfalfa's doing.

You come with me, Darla, and I'll show you what I've done.", "And you want to sing... na, na, na, na, na.", "That's enough.", "No singing anymore.", "Well there's a real important point there to me, Neal. I mean, they get my award of awards, I mean even more than Sammy Davis. Because you know we go to the movies to see ourselves in some way, and you know the Little Rascals and the Our Gang comedies by Hal Roach were enough of a metaphor or an emblem that even E.L. Doctorow at the end of his novel Ragtime, you know, picks them as a kind of emblem of America and what America had become. And for many generations, The Little Rascals have sort of seeped into the national consciousness. I give them an ensemble award.", "And lest us forget that one of the late members of the ensemble was Robert Blake.", "That's right.", "And now on - well, now doing what everybody in Hollywood is doing, he's on trial.", "We're talking with Murray Horwitz of the AFI Silver Theater, and we're talking today about best and worst child performances.

Listeners offer their picks at the TALK OF THE NATION page at npr.org. And well, you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "And let's get another caller on the line. This is Christopher(ph). Christopher calling us from Nevada.", "Yes, hi. I think that Macaulay Culkin for his work in The Good Son actually falls under both categories.", "Well if you think about it, Shirley Temple, late in her career, fell into both categories, too. But anyway, what were you thinking, Christopher?", "I was thinking that he did a great performance. He was very convincing, but I actually thought it was - I put it under bad performance as well simply because it's kind of disturbing that they'd have a child actor do and say all those dark things that he portrayed.", "Yeah, people putting words in kids' mouths.", "That's very true. And also the other thing about Macaulay Culkin -and you mentioned late Shirley Temple - there's  - the poor kid, you know, I mean there's overexposure. So finally you want to say get him or her just off the screen. I'm just annoyed by them by now.", "Absolutely. The worst thing about the success of the movie Seabiscuit was the fact that they re-ran the old movie, the Story of Seabiscuit, with Shirley Temple's first on-screen kiss, which we could all skip. But, of course, we mostly remember Macaulay Culkin from Home Alone.", "(As Kevin) Everyone in this family hates me.", "Ms. CATHERINE O'HARA (Actress): (As Kate) Then maybe you should ask Santa for a new family.", "(As Kevin) I don't want a new family. I don't want any family. Families suck.", "And that...", "Talk about putting words into the mouths of youngsters.", "Yeah, really. And the immortal Catherine O'Hara wasted in that movie. Not enough work. Christopher, thanks very much for the call. Let's go with -this is Mike(ph). Mike's calling from East Lansing in Michigan.", "Yes, hello.", "Hi there.", "The worst actor - child actor I can think of, I don't recall his name, but the movie was Problem Child with John Ritter. I think there was a sequel and they were both equally as bad.", "Michael Oliver is the actor's name.", "Okay.", "And by now he's probably 6'8\" and weighs 280 and he's going to come and get me for this, but - don't shoot the messenger, Michael. It's - he gets a lot of votes for worst performance that not only is, as the title of Problem Child would suggest, a sort of obnoxious kid, it's really not a great performance.", "Mike, thanks very much.", "Thank you.", "Here's an e-mail. This is from Sue B.(ph). The winner has to be, hands-down, Cammie King for her role as Bonny Blue Butler in the film classic Gone With the Wind. As a teenager in the late 60s, a friend and I attended a theater showing of this movie, which had quite a big audience. The first words the actress uttered were delivered in an ear-bleeding, nails-on-a-chalkboard, whiny screech which never did change throughout the entire performance. When she met her death from a fall off her pony, the entire audience broke into raucous cheers and applause. Now that's one bad performance.", "There's a terrible, terrible story - a theater story about a very, very bad amateur production of The Diary of Anne Frank. And at the moment that the Nazis break in, the entire audience says she's in the attic.", "Let's talk with Stephan(ph). Stephan with us from Orem in Utah.", "Hi, guys. I'm glad I could make it through. I forgot to send my e-mail; I had two weeks to do it. But it's got to be - best performance was Natalie Portman in Leon, The Professional.", "There are a lot of votes for that too, Stephan. She's the orphan of a slain family. She has either befriended or adopted or otherwise has a relationship with Jean Reno as a hitman.", "He's a great hitman, too.", "Gary Oldman's in the movie, and it's truly an extraordinary performance.", "Yeah, it was. The fact that she had to act so old and so grown up and she was only 11 years old and she was forced to do that because of the slaying of her drug family, that it was just amazing that she could pull off something like that.", "One of our film programmers at the AFI Silver, Laurie Donnelly(ph), says that if you're impressed by that there is a French movie, a Jacques Doillon movie, called Ponette from 10 years ago in which a girl, Victoire Thivisol, is 5 years old, plays an orphan, and does the same sort of thing at the age of 5. She said it'll just blow you away.", "Terrific. Poonette(ph), you say?", "Ponelle(ph). I'm sorry, Ponette. P-O-N-E-T-T-E.", "Thanks very much for the call, Stephan.", "Thank you.", "Bye-bye. Here's another e-mail, this from Todd(ph). My vote for best child actor would be Mara Hobel's performance of a young Christina Crawford from Mommie Dearest. I think she is best for being the worst.", "It's good. That's true. I had forgotten about that. That's a very good suggestion.", "Let's get one last call in here. Scott(ph). Scott calling from Grand Rapids in Michigan.", "Hello, yeah. Long-time listener, first-time caller. I have to nominate the performance by the actor who plans Anakin in Episode I: Star Wars - a chance to break out an unbelievable, in my opinion, in the first three movies. It revitalized the franchise and totally blows it in just every scene.", "I was worried you were going for best there for a while.", "Right.", "Heck, no. No way. It was making me cry, but definitely not for the right reasons.", "The only actor who could get upstaged by Jar-Jar, let's put it that way.", "True enough.", "Scott, thanks very much for the call.", "You're welcome.", "Next week we're going to be here with the next in our series, the best road movie.

The prison is run by the sheriff of Cook County, Tom Dart.", "Among the series of reforms he's recently implemented is an increase in video cameras, including body cameras on supervisors, in the hope of reducing the number of cases in which guards have abused inmates. And sometimes, those videos are released to the public. Sheriff Tom Dart joins us now from Chicago. Thanks so much for being with us.", "Oh, thanks for having me on, Scott.", "What made you decide to do this?", "You know, Scott, we'd been trying to sort of open up the view of this place to the public pretty much from day one. But we had to get through some of these hurdles so that, in the event of bad things going on in jail, we're not going to hide from it. We're going to be transparent. And we'll attempt to work through firing, criminally charging, if - as necessary as well - but to let the public know that we're trying. We're not involved with some cover-up, or this isn't some big secret.", "Bad things going on - I mean, to be plain about it, you mean mostly guards abusing inmates?", "Yeah, in cases of excessive force. So where it's clear that a correctional officer has exceeded what the norms require because clearly - obviously, in every jail and prison, correctional officers and guards will have to put their hands on a detainee sometimes to get them to respond. And more often than not, that's appropriate. But in the cases where they've gone beyond that and it's excessive, there needs to be immediately reaction from us.", "Can you tell us about a couple?", "Some of the activity was, for all intents and purposes in my view, were - was harmless. It was a detainee just talking back or something like that. And then the correctional officer in a case struck him then.", "There's another case on the other end of the spectrum where a detainee was waiting for the correctional officers to come through his door for lock-up. And when they got near the door, he pushed the door open, slamming the door into the correction officers, knocking them down. And then he started running. They tackled him. All that was fine, but then one of the officers took it to the next step and was just kneeing him and punching him in the face even though he was down already.", "It really runs the spectrum. But they were all cases that we felt pretty strongly were not representative of how you should be conducting yourself.", "Not to make any excuses for any kind of misconduct, but I'm sure you've spoken with corrections officers and maybe police officers who have said, over the years, that if somebody strikes a prison official, they feel the need for the retribution to be instantaneous and not to go through a legal system. They need to demonstrate that those officers aren't there to be trifled with.", "Yeah. And, you know, Scott, frankly, it's that mindset that has gotten everyone into so much trouble because there are systems that are set up to deal with a detainee who is not complying with the rules that you need to run a correctional facility. And striking them is not one of them. And what it does is it breeds an environment, then, where violence is the norm. And there is not the distinction between the professionals and the people who are being incarcerated because of some act that they did on the street. And you have to have it so that the public has faith that there isn't one set of rules for the people on the street and there's another set of rules for law enforcement. You have to have one set of rules.", "Any concern that any correctional officer that you might want to discipline or could even result in a legal case will have his or her rights potentially violated by releasing the video?", "We wait until there's been a thorough investigation that has sustained the facts that there has been excessive force. And then it goes to a hearing. So there's a myriad of eyes that are looking at this to make sure that it is, in fact, done appropriately. And we feel very confident that, at the end of the day, with the videos that are released, they're the ones that has gone through all of the screening ahead of time to make sure that everyone's rights are being looked after.", "Sheriff Dart, do you hope all the video surveillance might deter abusive behavior from corrections officers or, for that matter, outrageous things done by inmates?", "Probably one of the top reasons we did this was not just to catch things on the back end after bad things happen, but for the majority of cases where, frankly, it's detainee on detainee, that it would be easier to find out who did what to who and when. Cases where detainees are setting fires or are otherwise trying to break different things within the correctional facility, we'd be able to catch that proactively. And then for the rare cases where we have excessive force, that everybody would know we have cameras everywhere.", "So underlying so much of what we did was the notion that there was going to be this deterrent effect throughout the place both for detainees, employees and everyone else involved.", "The sheriff of Cook County, Tom Dart - thanks so much.", "Scott, thank you so much."], "speaker": ["SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "TOM DART", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "TOM DART", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "TOM DART", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "TOM DART", "TOM DART", "TOM DART", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "TOM DART", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "TOM DART", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "TOM DART", "TOM DART", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "TOM DART"], "snorkel_label": [-1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 4, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 4, -1, -1, -1, -1]}

This weekend, the big international story is ongoing tensions with North Korea which defied world pressure yesterday by testing another missile.", "As for President Trump, observers are noting that his foreign policy has been marked by a series of decisions seemingly at odds with his rhetoric on the campaign trail from the relevance of NATO to greater involvement in the Syria conflict. To talk more about Trump's foreign policy approach so far, we called Dennis Ross. He has advised four different U.S. presidents on foreign policy. He's with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. And I started our conversation by asking about President Trump's first 100 days and how this period compares to that of other administrations.", "Well, so far I would say he does not look so far outside the mainstream. He has acted to reassure allies which was something that was put in doubt during the campaign. He has said explicitly that NATO is relevant. He has had a large number of meetings with foreign leaders. He's now planning a trip abroad. He apparently is going to go to the NATO summit.", "He seems to be focused heavily on assuring others that even when he wants there to be more equitable burden-sharing, which by the way when it comes to the sharing of burdens, this is not a new concept. We have had many presidents talk about the need to share burdens. He has put more of a premium on that. But still, he doesn't seem to be shaping some kind of fundamentally new approach or one that has any kind of isolationist characteristic to it.", "So for many people, for some people, let's say, some of his supporters, surely, these represent a change of mind, charitably, or a flip-flop, uncharitably. Do you see some through line among these issues in which you see him as frankly more consistent with precedent than, perhaps, he thought he would be?", "I do, but I also think some of this can be accounted for by simply the reality of it's one thing to be a candidate. It's something else to be president. And he's not the first one to discover that. You know, President Clinton when he was a candidate when it referred to Bosnia, he said he was going to carry out a policy of lift and strike. He was going to lift the embargo on arms, so that the Bosnian-Muslims wouldn't suffer, and he was going to carry out airstrikes against the Serbs.", "And when he got in, he didn't do that. He decided it was in a sense more challenging, complicated than they thought. Well, we have seen President Trump say that he was going to label China as a currency manipulator. He didn't do that. He obviously has adopted, I think, a strong position rhetorically on North Korea, but he also said after speaking to the president of China for 10 minutes, he had a better appreciation of what the relationship was with China and North Korea, that China does have leverage, but it was more complicated than he had thought.", "Do you see a guiding foreign policy principle emerging?", "I don't really see that yet. I would say if one were going to characterize the Trump administration so far, I think it's basically a reassertion of American power, but not at this point necessarily an explanation of where with regard to what priorities. We certainly see a characterization of threat, and that's most clearly that relates to North Korea. But I don't think we have a kind of broad approach that integrates the role of power with a set of political objectives.", "And I think that's obviously something that is likely to emerge over time. It wouldn't be the first administration that would not have shaped such an approach in its first hundred days. And, obviously, we're still waiting to see it happen here.", "To that end, though, there are those who have criticized this administration in particular for seeming to be particularly unorganized. There are many unfilled positions in the administration especially it seems in the State Department. The administration seems to have struggled at times to present a unified front on foreign policy.", "Right.", "Do you see it that way? I mean, do they need to still get their act together administratively?", "Well, there's no doubt that the process of putting people in positions has been an unusually slow one. You don't have deputy secretaries of defense or state. You don't have undersecretaries of defense or state who have been appointed. And I think right now in the Trump administration, you have a small number of people having to carry out a very large number of tests. And I think that's one of the reasons it's going to take more time before you see a clear approach formulated and that one that can also be explained.", "That's Ambassador Dennis Ross. He's a longtime U.S. diplomat. He's now a distinguished fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

His accomplice, Lee Boyd Malvo, is expected to testify against him. Madeleine Brand discusses the latest in the case with Washington Post reporter Eric Rich.", "utt": ["It's DAY TO DAY. I'm Noah Adams.", "And I'm Madeleine Brand. Four years ago the Washington, D.C. area was paralyzed by a series of sniper attacks. Ten people were killed by a man and a teenager who had a stranger father/son relationship. John Allen Muhammad is on trial in Maryland accused of six homicides. He has already been sentenced to death in Virginia. His accomplice, the teenager Lee Boyd Malvo, was sentenced to life in prison. Malvo is expected to testify for the prosecution against Muhammad and he could shed some light on who actually pulled the trigger and what the motive was. Eric Rich is covering the trial for the Washington Post. And Eric, those questions weren't answered in the previous trials? What do prosecutors believe?", "Prosecutors in Maryland haven't said what they believe yet, and I guess we'll learn a little more when Malvo takes the stand, assuming he does. But what happened in Virginia was shortly after Malvo and Muhammad were arrested, Malvo gave a number of statements to various investigators.", "And in those statements he claimed that he was the gunman in most of the shootings. He described some of them in fairly comprehensive detail. But in any case, later on in statements that he gave to the psychiatrist hired by the defense, Malvo said that he, in fact, was not the gunman, that he'd only been the gunman in one of the sniper shootings and that Muhammad pulled the trigger in all the rest.", "And he may also say what the motive was?", "Well, you know, we don't know. The prosecutors haven't offered a motive, they did not offer a motive here in their opening statements, but I think one of the things prosecutors hope to accomplish, and the state's attorney here in Montgomery county hopes to accomplish with this trial, is sort of providing some justice for the victims here in Montgomery county, but also some sort of larger closure for everybody in the community. And one way that that could be provided is by explaining what this 22 days of terror in October of 2002 were really about.", "And you may recall during the attacks themselves the snipers demanded a 10 million dollar payment, and Malvo said later that Muhammad intended to use the 10 million to build a compound in Canada where he would start up some sort of Utopian world. Very strange theory. Malvo's attorneys in Virginia thought Muhammad's actual goal was to kill his ex-wife and regain custody of three of his children. So maybe further light might be shed on that if Malvo does in fact get to the issue of motive.", "Everyone speculated that he was sort of in the thrall of this older man, maybe brainwashed by him. And I'm wondering if there's any indication that he will actually testify quite strongly against Muhammad, or if indeed his testimony would be a risk for prosecutors.", "Malvo's looking at life with no chance of parole, and that means he's not getting out, and there's nothing that Maryland can do and the prosecutors here can do to give him a break from that. So he or at least people who are close to the trial have described his motivation in testifying here in Montgomery against Muhammad as part of a sort of personal redemption kind of exercise, where he's grown up and realized that now he wants to confront Muhammad.", "Are there risks for the prosecution? Well, I talked to a number of lawyers about that and some lawyers thought there was this tremendous possible benefit of really explaining this crime. However, other defense attorneys not involved in the case told me that there are risks and he has nothing to lose. And I'll tell you one of the people who told me that was the prosecutor in Virginia who prosecuted Malvo. The worst case scenario would be Malvo could blurt out something that would force a mistrial, however unlikely that may be.", "Muhammad is representing himself, so there could be this strange spectacle of him actually cross-examining Malvo, right?", "That is absolutely right. I mean, especially because Malvo's defense in Virginia, one of the defenses, was that if he did commit these crimes he was essentially brainwashed into murder. You know, you have the story of Malvo as a younger man in the Caribbean, a teenager, sort of fell in with Muhammad, who became a father figure and who he grew really close to, and by the time that, you know, the sniper attacks were happening, Muhammad was referring to Malvo as his son and he's continued to refer to him as his son.

Thank you very much. What was voting day like?", "Well, it was pretty chaotic. Every polling place I visited in the capital and dozens of polling places across the country reported large problems with disorganization, unprepared polling officials, lost materials, biometric equipment that didn't work, very, very, very long lines. Many of the polls opened three, four, five hours late. Some did not open at all. So it was a well-intentioned effort, but the practical results were pretty chaotic.", "Is it clear that enough ballots were cast in a legitimate way that this will feel like a legitimate result?", "That's a good question, and I can't answer it yet because as you mentioned, you know, a large number of voters in one province, Kandahar, where there were some serious killings in the past few days, has - have been delayed for one week. And in a second province, Ghazni, where there have been recent attacks as well, that voting has also been delayed.", "So you've got two provinces where the voting hasn't even happened yet, and you also have dozens of - possibly even hundreds of polling stations both in Kabul and elsewhere where people had to vote yesterday - a second day of voting because the polls never opened on election day itself.

So we have no idea who won these elections and - given that they're not even quite over. But let me ask you about what the winners will face. We should note people know from a distance that Afghanistan has had a very powerful president to the extent that it's had a central government at all. And of course a lot of decisions in some cases are in the hands or influenced by the United States, influenced by allies or, for that matter, influenced by the Taliban, which controls portions of the country. Will this parliament, once it's seated, have much to say? What will their role be?", "That's also a good question. I think and I hope that the country is in for a change.

The belief is that when blood vessels are damaged by LDL or that bad cholesterol, the smooth muscle cells are triggered to proliferate. So they build up scar tissue that makes the vessel both narrow and hardened.", "And these changes can restrict blood flow and may cause heart attack or stroke, a leading cause of death in America.

Thank you very much.", "You're welcome.", "And we're enjoying the work that you're helping us broadcast about, which is what I want to talk today about. This is really interesting. Before the study, we thought that clogged arteries are clogged by how? And what have you done to change that view?", "Well, I think that the prevailing idea was that clogged arteries are caused by a group of cells that exist around a blood vessel, and they begin to grow or proliferate, as you had mentioned. And I guess it's sort of like a pair of Spanx that goes out of control.", "You know, normally the cells around the vessel hold it in a snug manner, but when the cells around the blood vessel grow too much, then they narrow the lumina(ph), the diameter of the vessel. And I think that's where the big - of course we understood which cells were responsible, or I should say we thought we knew, and that's where Song Lee(ph) and his students made a really critical insight.", "They saw that instead of this - just smooth muscle cells, there was actually two populations, and the second was a stem cell-like population. This appears to be the cells that caused the trouble.", "So the stem cells start to proliferate and create smooth muscle cells on the wall of the artery?", "They create all sorts of things - excuse me. As a consequence of their being stem cells, of course they're capable of differentiating into lots of different cell types, and that's what Song showed. He showed that they could differentiate into fat-producing adipocytes, bone-producing osteoblasts, even differentiate into neural cells.", "And that's where he made a key discovery, I think, in that understanding that these were stem cells.", "And so these cells, would they be lining the artery walls in all different forms, as...", "That's right.", "You know, that's why there's calcium deposits there sometimes perhaps, because it may be bone?", "That's right. That's - the capability of these cells to differentiate into bone-producing cells is, of course, associated with vascular diseases. And so I guess where I came in was that we were working on these areas. Even though he works just across the Bay from me - I met him at a meeting in Japan that was sponsored by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, or CIRM, and they fund a lot of stem cell research in California.", "And so what did you do to prove this, to show it in operation?", "So the important part was to be able to demonstrate that these cells really were stem cells, and he had an idea that they were derived from a population called the neural crest. And that's the area that I work in. Neural crest cells are an embryonic population of cells that have the same ability to make fat, bone, cartilage, nerve, and as a consequence of the similarities between the two cell types, we found that indeed the cells that exist around the vessels, these stem cell-like, the stem cells that exist around the vessels, look like neural crest cells.", "This gives us a real handle on what their behavior is and what might regulate them in disease states.", "Well, if you see them there, could you actually show them in action clogging the arteries up?", "Well, in action is a difficult thing because that requires some kind of dynamic visualization of the process. And, you know, it's a slow process, getting our arteries hardened. But what you can do is create the disease in animals and then follow, using genetic strategies, follow the fates of the cells so that we can sort of indelibly label the cells, when they're still stem cells, and then follow where they go in the disease state.", "And using that kind of approach, we are able to show that they are indeed stem cells.", "So you can label them with a dye or something and see where they proliferate, and if they line the arteries, there they are, and they're creating stuff.", "Yes, very close to that. It's a genetic strategy, so it's not a dye, actually, but a gene that makes a protein that can be detected by a dye reaction.", "1-800-989-8255, talking with Dr. Jill Helms, saying that - if I may summarize this, and correct me if I'm wrong - is that stem cells are at the root of hardening of the arteries. That simple.", "Yes, yes.", "Wow, and...", "I will say that one of the big opportunities this presents is that when you know the cause of a disease, then you can start thinking about ways to target that disease process. And this is where our collaboration is going. And Song has developed a number of techniques to rapidly screen drugs that will specifically target these cells and not the cells that line a blood vessel, called the endothelial cells, so sparing one cell and targeting the other for therapy.", "But stem cells are all over the body, are they not? Could you target the wrong kinds of stem cells if you just...", "Absolutely, that's certainly a concern. And so it's lucky that they are spatially restricted, so we know exactly where they reside. If one were to think about targeting, you'd have to take into account that sort of spatial component.", "1-800-989-8255 is our number. Now, with the discovery that stem cells cause heart disease and hardening of the arteries, would they not be good candidates for other things that go wrong?", "Exactly. Right. So instead of now - now, of course, the therapies for treating hardening of the arteries or narrowing of the blood vessels are mostly procedures that physically widen the inside of the blood vessel or else replace the damaged by grafting.", "Like a stent or something like that.", "That's exactly right. So there may be an opportunity here to think about regenerating the correctly formed kind of stem cells that reside around the blood vessels.", "And would they - would they be able to replace the damaged ones, if they regenerate?", "Well, of course that's still in the future, but I think that that's definitely a feasible option.", "And as far as things that are not concerned with the heart, other illnesses, could stem cells - let me just throw out a few illnesses. Could they be involved in arthritis or something else like that, and we don't know that yet, you know?", "That's right. We don't know it about arthritis, but I will tell you that cancer is certainly a disease that looks very much like a stem cell gone out of control. And so if we understand what normally regulates a stem cell's behavior, then we gain some crucial insights into what regulates maybe a cancer cell's behavior.", "It's that kind of approach that I think that CIRM is largely funding initiatives to try to target human diseases, the big ones, and the ones that make us all sort of quake in our shoes, and attempt to come up with new therapies.", "Yeah, a couple of questions come to mind, is why - and you'd want to know why only in some people do the stem cells get activated to do...", "That's right.", "Right? What's the vulnerability there?", "What is - and we know some of the things, right? We know some things that activate stem cells like repeated injuries, things like smoking. Inhalation injury triggers activation of cells, stem cells around the lumen of the bronchials. Or drinking to excess, you know, damages the liver, activating stem cells there that then go out of control.", "So clearly understanding how injuries, some environmental influences, and of course the genetics of each individual, how those may play into activating these stem cells and leading to disease.", "Bridget(ph) in Raleigh, North Carolina wants to join us. Welcome, Bridget.", "Hi.", "Hi there.", "I just had a quick question. When you refer to hardening of the arteries, are you referring to arteriosclerosis, arthrosclerosis, or both in this context?", "I think both is a fair - certainly arthrosclerosis.", "One is - tell us the difference, quickly, between them, Dr. Helms.", "Well, you know, this is getting outside of my area of expertise because I'm not a cardiologist.", "Well, there's a simple - I mean, one - I'll just take a shot at it.", "OK.", "One is thickening of the - one is narrowing of the passageway in the arteries, and the other is actually hardening of the arteries, and those are two different things. Would I - would you go that far with me?", "Yes. I'd go that far, I guess, because I'm thinking about the contribution of these cells...", "Right.", "...to disease. I would say it's more closely linked to atherosclerosis.", "And that is the narrowing of the arteries.", "Yeah.", "Yeah. And what do the stem cells normally do when they're there and they're not doing, you know, turning into - doing this bad thing? What do they normally do...", "Yeah.", "...in the body there?", "You know, we have no idea.", "We don't?", "We have no idea what their normal role is sitting there. And then that begs the question, how did they get there? Where did they come from? Were they always there from the beginning of our embryonic life, or did they migrate there in response to a stimulus? We don't know.", "Wow. But we knew they were there for how long? When did we discover that?", "Oh, only recently.", "Yeah.", "This is - I think this is probably the biggest discovery that comes out of this work from Song Li and his colleagues and that - in which I participated.", "So wouldn't you think if there are just stem cells in the arteries, and they're - and we know they're - we know that they float around in the bloodstream that there are stem cells everywhere else, in other tissue, in (unintelligible).", "Well, stem cells don't float around much in the bloodstream, unless they're blood stem cells. And most of the blood stem cells are actually in the marrow. So they don't float around. Cells really like to attach to things. You know, that's how they grow, and that's how they - they have to - stem cells have to be close to something we call the niche, which is a physical location that provides growth signals to keep the stem cells in a quiescent state. So how did they get there? You know, they didn't just crawl through the body. Something had to have caused them to be there, maybe from the beginning of our development...", "Yeah.", "...or maybe not.", "Now, your work involves laboratory animals.", "That's correct.", "When will this be moved over to humans, to look at humans in these (unintelligible)?", "Well, I think that's one of the, you know, most basic scientists that work in stem cells and in the area of stem cell are trying as hard as possible to move this into translational therapies, things that can be used in humans. And, of course, CIRM, our funding institution, is very adamant about this being the trajectory. So, you know, I'll be taking a stab at it about five to seven years. I think that the ability to rapidly screen existing drugs for their ability to target this cell population is why we think that it might have a shorter course to getting into humans.", "Let's go to Gina(ph) in Barrington, New Jersey. Hi, Gina.", "Hi. How are you?", "Hi there.", "Yes. I find this very interesting. I actually used to do a little bit of research myself in atherosclerosis and diabetes. And we kind of looked at things from a higher - kind of a higher outlook. And I wonder what your thoughts were on, with the stem cells actually congregating and proliferating there, why would they actually be going there, and would you believe this to be part of this theory that inflammation in of itself, that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, and that is really the root cause is actually lifestyle, eating behaviors and lack of activity in general that's causing our body to react in an inflammatory manner?", "All right, Gina, thanks.", "Wow, that's a great question. What causes them to get to the site of injury or where the injury happens and what activates them if they're already there? And inflammation, as the caller pointed out, is a key feature of a lot of kinds of diseases, including this one. And so it may well play a role. The difficulty is that most mouse models or animal models that try to sort of test the contributions of the immune system, we can only knock out certain parts of the immune system. It's very hard to collectively say it's due to an immune response or an inflammatory response. But it's clearly on the shortlist of the causes that lead to the activation of these cells.", "You know, whenever you come up with a sort of paradigm-shifting idea, like this seems to be, there's great resistance to accept it.", "Oh, yeah.", "Yeah.", "Yeah. But sometimes, I think scientists recognize - it's sort of the aha, right? Oh, it's like, I guess, yeah, if you look hard, sure enough, there they are. So I think it is - there is resistance oftentimes, but there can be moments where there's great clarity. And I think Song's work certainly falls within that category.", "Will it have to be repeated by others to confirm what (unintelligible)?", "You know, that is exactly how science is done - show again. It's called research, not search. So, I guess, that means that, yes, absolutely. We need to confirm it in other animals too, and now, the group is getting human cells from diseased arteries, coronary arteries, to see if this paradigm still holds true in humans. Of course, that's our target.", "Yeah. Is it the same kind of stem cells in humans as in these lab animals?", "Yes, they appear to be very, very similar. There's pretty much an indistinguishable - if there are differences, we haven't found them yet...", "Let me get a...", "...so that makes...", "Yeah.", "...that makes mice a pretty good model.", "Let me get a quick question here from Andrew in Morristown, Tennessee. Hi, Andrew.", "Hi. How are you all today?", "Hi there.", "My question is - well, first, I have a comment. I've believed for a number of years that stem cells are going to really just be a great thing in the medical, like, community. I think that...", "Andrew, if you have a question you got to get in soon because we're running of out of time.", "OK. Sorry. Do you think that this new study will hurt stem cell research?", "OK.", "Absolutely not. The more we know about how stem cells behave, the more we can control that behavior, whether it's to repress them or to activate them. So it's all about getting the instruction manual for how a stem cell works. That's our goal. And with that information in hand, we can attack a lot of diseases.", "Were these embryonic stem cells or were they other stem - kinds of stem cells?", "These were adult stem cells.

This is the first major U.N. summit on controlling greenhouse gas emissions in more than five years. It is a huge test of international diplomacy. And the woman leading this effort the U.N. joins us now. She is Costa Rican diplomat Christiana Figueres. Welcome to the program.", "Hi, Ari. Thanks very much for having me.", "You have been at the center of this effort for five years. What keeps you awake at night?", "Well, what keeps me awake at night is this inherent paradox that we have, which is that the advance of policy, whether it is at sub-national, nationaL or, in this case, international level, is a gradual advance. On the other hand, and paradoxically, that gradual advance of policy needs to respond to the urgency of the problem. For climate change perspectives, it needs to be done within the next five to 10 to, maximum, 15 years, so that paradox...", "So you're saying the kind of change humanity has to make is the kind of change that humans have never made in the history of our existence as a species.", "Yes. The answer is yes.", "And you're convinced that it can be done?", "Yes because, you know, just - let's look very quickly at the leap that the information and technology sector has had. Who would have believed, you know, that we have the reach with cellular telephony that we have now way surpassing anything that landlines could ever have done? It is fantastic for me to go to, you know, small, little, poor, developing countries and find a woman way out there in some little hut, picking up her cell phone and doing cell banking. That is the kind of transformation that we need to have in the energy sector. Is it possible - yes. We have most of the technology that we need. We have the capital. We're moving on the policy. We just need to focus and understand the urgency of this. And yes, I do think that we, as humanity, will be able to address this challenge.", "You have talked about the business opportunities presented by clean energy technology, but is the business community really on board with what has to be done?", "Well, understandably, you have some corporations that are still trying to figure out how do they transform themselves. In particular, fossil fuel companies are having the hardest time because they have a huge amount of pressure to be able to figure out how do they transform themselves from fossil fuel companies to energy companies - you know, a complete reframing of their business model. But that's, you know, one sector. Every day, I am surprised to see how many more companies are joining this search for - how do we reinvent ourselves, and how do we bring this forward? And I have to underline; they're doing it because of the self-interest of business profitability not just now but in the long run.", "The United States has said that by 2030, it will cut its greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent compared to 2005 levels. If the United States falls down on that commitment, where is the accountability?", "The accountability is first to itself but also to all of the other nations.", "So does it just mean public shaming?", "There's no, you know, environmental police running around with a pistol pointed at anybody's head. That is definitely not the case. But I think the interesting thing to understand here is, these climate change plans that have already been put forward - we already have 157 of them - they stem from a very deep analysis and cross-sectoral consultation inside each of the countries that have presented them, yes, certainly to obey the global climate change agenda and move that forward, but primarily because it is in their national interest, because they can see that this actually gives them much better air quality. It gives them better transportation. It gives them better food security, water security because they are understanding that we can no longer continue down the path of increasing the risk of non-action. And that is the very interesting turning point where Paris will actually not create that turning point. It will mark it.", "Christiana Figueres, good luck in Paris, and thank you for talking with us.", "Thank you very much, Ari.", "Christiana Figueres is executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Senate Republicans scored a narrow but meaningful victory in the party's effort to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Senator John McCain, who was just diagnosed with brain cancer, returned to Washington for that vote, and Vice President Mike Pence had to be the tiebreaker. So now the Senate can begin debating health care legislation. But what happens next on health care? Well, no one seems to know for sure. NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis is on Capitol Hill, and she is with us now. And, Sue, you were in the chamber for the vote. What was it like?", "You know, most votes in Congress have predetermined outcomes. You know what's going to happen before the vote's over. This was really a nail-biter until the very end. Moments before the vote, it became clear it was likely going to pass when holdouts like Dean Heller of Nevada and Rob Portman of Ohio announced that they were going to vote yes with the party. In the end, the only two noes were two moderate senators who we knew were likely noes, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. And of course, the vote would have failed if not for, as you said, Kelly, the return of Arizona Senator John McCain, who is battling brain cancer and came back to vote to move forward on health care.", "And what was his return to the floor like today?", "He, you know, was greeted with a standing ovation and applause. His return was certainly sort of a factor in the mood up here in keeping the pressure on lawmakers to move forward on this bill. But in sort of a classic McCain move, he came back to help the party, and then in a speech immediately after chastised his colleagues for writing the bill the way they have. Take a listen to McCain on the floor.", "We've been spinning our wheels on too many important issues because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle. That's an approach that's been employed by both sides - mandating legislation from the top down without any support from the other side with all the parliamentary maneuvers that requires. We're getting nothing done, my friends. We're getting nothing done.", "And McCain made a very important point that a lot of other Senate Republicans have said they were a yes today, they're agreeing to start debating health care, but they might still be a no on whatever legislation Republicans ultimately come up with in the end.", "OK. This vote allows them to start debating health care, as you just said. But what bill exactly are they going to be debating?", "This is the greatest mystery in Washington right now, Kelly.", "OK.", "You know, the motion that - today, the base bill is what the House has passed. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's going to offer a couple amendments to swap out that bill for legislation that would just repeal Obamacare and another vote on legislation that's more closer to the Senate version of the health care bill. If any combination of those passes, they'll become the new baseline. We don't know the outcome of those votes. So after they get through that, we're just going to start later this week on an amendment process that will essentially let every senator - even Democrats here - weigh in on health care and offer amendments to a bill to shape it as it goes.", "So does that mean that this legislation is basically going to be written on the floor of the Senate as this debate unfolds?", "Essentially, yes. You know, I - we don't know what the end product is going to look like on health care. We know that they are on the bill now. McConnell is also keeping in his back pocket another option that has emerged this week that is being referred to as Skinny Repeal, which is essentially the most pared-down version of what Republicans say they can agree on, which would simply repeal the individual mandate and employer mandates and some of the taxes in Obamacare.", "If they - the goal, I am told, is to just get something through the Senate that will then allow Senate Republicans to go into negotiations with House Republicans and see if the two chambers can ultimately come up with a bill that they can pass. The bottom line here is if they do pass some kind of a health care bill later this week, it means that the health care fight in Congress is likely going to continue into the fall and maybe well into the fall.", "All right, we'll keep watching it.

There's nothing new about this, of course.  For as long as there      have been hot concerts, there have been people buying and selling tickets      to them and trying to make a few bucks in the process.  But the Internet      has made it much easier for sellers and buyers to hook up.  There are      hundreds of Web sites that now sell tickets to sold-out events.

And this week, it announced it would team up      with a second site called TicketsNow.com.  These sites sometimes offer      tickets for well above face value.  For instance, you can buy a great      seat for Paul McCartney's upcoming concert in Miami on TicketsNow.com,      but it will cost you more than $1,700.  Manuel Gonzales(ph) went to one      of the sites a few years ago to buy Grateful Dead tickets.  He says they      were selling for two to three times their face value.", "The tickets were outrageous.  They were overpriced.      They would pump up the value, I mean, as much as they could.  I mean, I      guess because they can get away with it, they charge you what they can.", "This kind of ticket selling can violate the law in some states,      but it can be difficult for states to regulate Internet ticket sales.      AOL says it expects people using its site to obey local laws, but the      company says as a middleman it isn't responsible if they don't.  Jim      Koplik says that when concert sales get overheated because of the      Internet, something he thinks happened with the Rolling Stones' tickets,      it distorts the market.", "There are tons of people that would have loved to have      bought tickets at the authorized price that the artist and the promoter      set it at, but instead there were people buying tickets and creating a      black market or a secondary market that they, in turn, profit in.", "AOL officials note that the ticket Web sites don't just offer      overpriced concert tickets, they also provide a place for people to sell      tickets they've bought but can't use.

Despite some bad reviews and claims of historical and theological errors, the movie version of The Da Vinci Code topped the weekend's box office sales, taking in $77 million. The central theme of both the novel and the movie revolves around the controversial idea that Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were married and had a child, and that the Catholic Church covered up the truth.", "Elaine Pagels is a Professor of religion at Princeton University. She's also the author of The Gnostic Gospels and Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas. In this Sunday's San Jose Mercury News, she wrote an op-ed piece arguing that Brown's story is a work of fiction, but what makes it so compelling is not the parts he made up but those parts that are true.", "If you've read the book or seen the movie, what are your questions about what's true or not in The Da Vinci Code. 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. And the e-mail address is talk@npr.org", "And, Elaine Pagels, nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today.", "Thank you. Good to be here.", "Professor Pagels is with us from her office in Princeton, New Jersey. And I guess we have to begin with the big one. Is there any evidence to support the idea that Jesus Christ was not crucified, got married, and he and Mary Magdalene had children?", "Well, there certainly isn't, although nothing's probably impossible historically, but there's no evidence that I know. I mean, it makes a great fiction novel, I think.", "And I guess that's the point, fiction.", "Yeah, it is. Although, you wonder if Dan Brown had said it was just fiction whether it would have been such a sensation. There is a lot in it that's very interesting and true.", "Well, you wrote in your piece, in fact, that Dan Brown credited you and your book on the Gnostic Gospels, particularly the Gospel of Philip, for sending him off on this novel.", "That's true. This is a secret Gospel. It was found - it's probably written in the early 2nd century and it has words like this, Jesus loved Mary Magdalene more than the other disciples and kissed her often. And the other disciples were jealous and asked, why do you love her more than all of us? Now, you know, in the Gospel of Philip that sounds pretty provocative.", "It sure does. Tell us, for those of us who don't follow such things closely, what are these Gnostic Gospels, when were they written, who wrote them, and how do they relate to the Gospels that we're familiar with in the New Testament?", "Well, those are big questions. I mean, what I learned in graduate school was a surprise, that there are many other Gospels that we didn't know about. A lot of them were buried and suppressed as early as the 2nd century and rediscovered, actually, in 1945 in an archeological find that was just amazing. We found about 50 ancient Christian texts. And so, you know, they show us a much more diverse picture of the early Christian movement than we ever saw before.", "And a picture, you say, the Church, neither then nor now, is altogether too happy with.", "Well, yes. But, you know, these texts are various. What they mainly claim is that certain disciples had secret teachings of Jesus and it differs in some ways from what the Church teaches.", "In an important way, what some of them suggest is that Christ was not himself divine, but human.", "Well, that's true; although it suggests he was human as we are, and also had a capacity to manifest God. And I guess one of the things that is disliked by many people in the churches is the suggestion that you and I are like that, too, that we are human but we have within us a connection with God because we're created in His image.", "A direct connection, as opposed to one that requires us to go through the church?", "Right. The church, in a way, invented a sort of technology of getting to God, which is not, I think, a bad thing. I'm not a conspiracy theorist like Dan Brown. But some of these texts suggest it's not necessary, that you can find God in yourself, you can find God in the universe.", "Of course, an idea that resulted some years later in a major theological split in the Christian churches?", "Oh, absolutely. I mean, most of the churches are based on the assumption that, you know, outside the church there's no salvation. That is, you have to go to the churches, you have to be saved through Jesus Christ, and so forth.", "Mm-hmm. And so this idea that these - there is hidden history to the gospels that were suppressed by the church. Dan Brown writes about that. And broadly, you're saying, he got that right.", "He did. And that's the great adventure that those of us who work on these texts are exploring at this point. Actually, I find what we - what the real story is more interesting to me than what we could make up, because it does show a secret gospel of Mary Magdalene, for example.", "And saying that - talking a lot more about the feminine side.", "Well, that's true, and that's another thing Dan Brown picked up from some of these sources. That is, if you can speak of God, who anyway would be infinite, in masculine form as a father and king and judge and all of that, you could also speak of God in feminine form as Holy Spirit and mother, because those words in Hebrew and Syriac are feminine words; Holy Spirit, wisdom, and so forth.", "Well, let's get some listeners in on the conversation. If you'd like to join us, our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. Our e-mail address is talk@npr.org.", "We'll start with Greg(ph).

Dr. Pagels, I read in your book on the Gnostic gospels, I believe it was, in the introduction you refer to that quotation from the Gospel of Philip about the...", "Yes.", "...kissing often. And I noticed in your work, when I checked your footnote, you had inserted, on the mouth, but in the original there's a hole there. How did you come up with that?", "Well, that's right. That's a good point. What happens, you know, is these texts are made out of papyrus. They're very ancient, and if you touch them they crumble. There're many parts of them that are broken, so it says, just as you said, Jesus kissed her often on her, and then the text breaks and you never know.", "Yeah.", "So no, I wasn't the person who put that word in, but others who worked on it before realized that the word mouth would fit in the space that's missing. Now, maybe other words would fit in the space and you can imagine what they might be, but that's the one that most people thought was most appropriate.", "So they put the word mouth in her mouth, as it were.", "That's absolutely correct. And you see...", "I just thought - when I checked the footnote, though, when I actually looked at what you were quoting from, it didn't say mouth there.", "Well, if you look at Robert McLloyd Wilson's(ph) edition, I think it was published about '59 - he's at the University of Edinburgh - he put that reconstruction in. But when you do, you're supposed to put little marks...", "Yeah.", "...that indicate that it's reconstructed. And that's what...", "The brackets. Yeah.", "Yeah, brackets, right.", "Yeah.", "All right, Greg, thanks very much for the call.", "Thanks.", "Bye-bye. Let's go now to Carl(ph). And Carl's with us from San Antonio.", "Yes. It seems to be odd how Mr. Brown has gone out and he announces this book as fiction, but it seems the whole Christian community feels threatened by a book that the author has gone out there and claimed it's fiction; which is almost like twenty years earlier, I believes it was Holy Blood, Holy Grail, they're almost similarly the same. But it just hits me odd how people can go up in arms and everything else on this.", "Well, Prof. Pagels, he said it was fiction, sort of.", "Well, he did, you know, I think you're right about that. And Holy Blood, Holy Grail is a really far-fetched thing. It's not really history. You're right. But the other side is, he said that it was all based on fact, you know, so he wanted it both ways.", "Yeah, I mean...", "And I think if he hadn't said that, then it wouldn't have been the sensation that it was.", "Yeah, but there's a lot of other stories that are out there that are the same thing, where they blend in fact with fiction.", "That's true.", "And to make you great novels and everything else. You know, like Gone With the Wind, that just didn't, you know...", "I guess somehow these here...", "I don't understand why people feel threatened by this book when it's, you know, the author himself has announced it as being fiction but a mixture with history. You know, in the same way as Gone With the Wind.", "Well, that's a good point. I mean, I find, as a piece of fiction, it's perfectly okay with me. But you're right; a lot of people take it very seriously.", "Well, a lot of people would consider some of these ideas heretical. Some of these ideas that they say are, you know, part of a, well, you know - this is an effort to undermine the church.", "Well, I gather that, you know, his purpose is rather anti-Catholic, and suggests that the Catholic Church, you know, or Opus Dei anyways, having people killed to keep the secrets hidden and so forth, I mean that's really far-fetched, I would think.", "Yeah, but it just hits me odd, that's all. That's all I wanted. All right, thank you.", "Thanks for the call, Carl.", "Bye.", "Opus Dei, of course, the previously mysterious group that is, in fact, a real group, which was willing to talk about itself a great deal, much more openly in the aftermath of The Da Vinci Code than it was beforehand.", "Well, they probably felt they had to.", "Yes. Let's get another caller on the line. This is Eric(ph). Eric calling from Macon, Georgia.", "Yes, I was wondering if Prof. Pagels can comment on the historical accuracy of the book and the movie concerning the first Ecumenical Council in Nicaea, and some of the issues that were involved.", "I think in the book, as I recall, it was implied that the divinity of the Christ was decided upon at the church council - at the instigation of the Emperor Constantine, and it was done, actually, with a rather close vote.", "I don't think that's exactly - that's an accurate depiction. What are your thoughts about it?", "Well, I'd have to check again, you know, exactly what he says there. It is true that at the Council of Nicaea the main issue was whether Jesus was to be considered God or not. I don't think the vote was close at all. I think you're right about that, it was overwhelmingly in favor of the creed, and the Emperor voted in favor of it.", "And when the Emperor voted in favor of it, anyone who didn't vote with the Emperor could easily be seen as, you know, kind of suspect.", "Or hurry and change their vote.", "(Unintelligible) vote for this at the council, though.", "Pardon me?", "I don't believe the Emperor voted at the council, though.", "He didn't vote, but I'm saying that the bishops who did tended to favor his point of view. Although, I think it was favored by many of the bishops, as well.", "In any case, an additional problem with the thesis that the Roman government forced that decision on the Council of bishops is that, at some point 20 or 30 years afterwards, the opposite position, the Arian position, and maybe you can comment about who Arius was, the Arian position came to the forefront and for some 50 or 60 years, Arianism was, at least the Roman government's...", "Yes, you're right. There's a very good book by Timothy Barnes, which you may have read, called Constantine and Eusebius, which talks about this.", "Arius was a priest from Libya who was preaching in Egypt, and he opposed the idea that Jesus was God incarnate and suggested that Jesus was human. And that debate, as you say, was intense and was very highly engaged for many decades by many bishops.", "We're talking with Elaine Pagels on TALK OF THE NATION's Opinion Page. She wrote a piece that was published yesterday in the San Jose Mercury News. If you would like to see a copy of that article, go to our website and there's a link to it: npr.org.", "Here are the headlines for some of the other stories we're following here today at NPR News.", "Louisiana Congressman William Jefferson, who's under investigation for bribery, was reportedly caught on videotape accepting $100,000 from an FBI informant. FBI Agents later found much of the cash in Jefferson's freezer, according to reports.", "And the National Hurricane Center is predicting that the 2006 Atlantic storm season will be very active for storms, with as many as ten hurricanes and 16 named storms. However, the center says this year should not be as bad as 2005. Of course, details on those stories and much more later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.", "Right now you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "And let's get back to Prof. Pagels and our conversation about The Da Vinci Code and the Gnostic Gospels. And interestingly in 1945 - that's the same year that the Dead Sea Scrolls were found.", "Absolutely. It's an amazing year, and there's only a small part of the Middle East that's so dry that papyrus doesn't rot, it actually survives. And that's where both the Dead Sea Scrolls and these texts were found in Egypt.", "Let's get another listener on the line. This is Carrie(ph). Carrie calling from Lawrence, Kansas.", "Hi.", "Hi, Carrie.", "I would like to say it's delightful to listen to you speak with all these gentleman callers.", "Thank you.", "One of the things - I've only read the book, I've not seen the movie. And the reason why I read the book, having sort of picked it up and sort of given it a cursory look at the bookstore and chose not to purchase it, was that later on, my 20-something car salesman was all excited about it. And I thought well, if my car salesman is excited about this feminist theology-based book, I think maybe I should go read it.", "My question, though, and this is a discussion that I had recently with my husband, is that, is there anywhere in - I guess it's implied, but does it say specifically anywhere that Christ was a virgin? Is there any reason that we should think that he was not sexually active?", "That's a very interesting question. I don't think anything is said about that that I know of in the New Testament or any other Gospel. I mean, some people suggest that he may have been married, because it was common for most rabbis to be married...", "(Unintelligible)", "...back then, as it is now. And because, you know, it might not have been a subject for comment, because it was just taken for granted.", "Mm-hmm.", "But there are teachings in the New Testament, at lest in Mark and Matthew, in which Jesus praises people who are single and celibate. And so, you know, blessed are the eunuchs, for they shall make themselves, you know, it's in Matthew 19. Those who make themselves eunuchs for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven, and those are people who are sexually inactive.", "Inactive.", "So there were at least suggestions that he was celibate, but we don't know that for sure. It's a good point.", "Well, thank you very much and I look forward to hearing the rest of the conversation.", "Okay, Carrie. Thanks very much. Let's turn now to Katherine(ph). And Katherine's calling from Minneapolis.", "Hi.", "Hi.", "Hello.", "I wanted to respond, actually to the earlier callers comment about -he was wondering why the church was so - or why members of the church have been outraged about the book when he claims that its fiction.", "Mm-hmm.", "I think that one of the messages that a lot of readers are taking away from Dan Brown's book is that we shouldn't necessarily look at the bible or biblical documents as, you know, literal documents that should be interpreted literally, or that we should necessarily take the church's interpretation of them, you know, at face value, but that we should look at them in an historical and cultural context of the time in which they were written. And that puts into question a lot of peoples' doctrine and belief about bible and the Christianity, in general.", "Well, I think that's a really good point. Historians do the same thing, though, whether they're Christians or not, and many of my teachers and colleagues are very definitely Christians; myself included. So, you know, looking at them in historical context, you're right, it does change it.", "Taking literally, though, doesn't just go on one side. I mean, I thought he took, you know, Jesus kissing Mary Magdalene, very literally. Because if you read the Gospel of Philip - further than he did - you realize that it's a mystical text and that she, here, represents the Holy Spirit or the Church, and the Church is the bride of Christ, as Christians know from the letters of St. Paul.", "So there's a great deal of symbolic and mystical language in these texts, which, you're perfectly right, shouldn't be taken literally, and which needs to be interpreted and understood spiritually.", "Katherine, thanks very much.", "Thank you.", "Prof. Pagels, have you seen the movie?", "Not yet.", "You looking forward to it?", "Well, I'd like to see it. Have you?", "Not yet. But I'm looking forward to it too.", "Elaine Pagels, thanks very much for your time today.", "Okay.

But is it really that simple? Lawrence Katz is a labor economist at Harvard University and co-author of the 2005 study, The Evaluation of Mexican Workforce in the United States. He points out that the American work force has changed significantly in the last 20 years because of a number of factors, including the waning influence of labor unions and the staggering growth in the number of foreign workers.", "Mr. Katz explained his findings to NPR's Farai Chideya.", "What we attempted to do is we tried to look at the hypothetical of what would have happened over the last 25 years if there had not been such a large increase in the number of immigrants, particularly from Mexico coming in to work in the United States.", "And what you see is when you get large shocks of workers coming across the border entering particular occupations is the vast majority of Americans benefit because the increase in supply of workers of these occupations lowers the prices. It's cheaper to get your walls plastered; it's cheaper to buy childcare services; it's cheaper to get food processed.", "On the other hand, so most of us benefit, but workers directly competing are paying the cost, because they receive lower wages and they get discouraged from entering these occupations and fields. So two groups gain big time. The immigrants themselves have huge increases in income. Most Americans benefit as consumers, but a small group of the most vulnerable Americans pay the cost.", "Do you have any more information on how undereducated workers, these low wage workers, break down by race and ethnicity, the ones who are U.S. citizens?", "Well, the U.S. citizens who are competing with immigrants are disproportionately African American, disproportionately Hispanic, you know, born in the United States.", "Is it conceivable that Mexican immigrants who have legal status are also losing out in wages?", "It's not only conceivable, it's highly probable. Most studies actually find the groups whose wages are most affected are the earlier wave of immigrants with similar sort of characteristics.

It's been a rocky two weeks for the president, from the violence in Charlottesville and his widely criticized response to it to the exit of chief strategist Steve Bannon, who left the White House with a promise to wage war on those who disagree with his nationalist agenda.

I guess it was last week - with The American Prospect that Steve Bannon gave. He says he didn't know it was an interview or on the record, but it was out there. And he was out there criticizing his colleagues, criticizing people in the State Department, the Defense Department, saying he was going to get his own guys in there and actually undercutting the president's own sort of public position on North Korea, saying there is no military option - when the president had said that.", "I'm curious. In an interview with your colleague at the Weekly Standard, Bannon declared the presidency of Trump that he fought for as over. How do you read that? Is it over?", "(Laughter) I mean, is it the presidency that Trump fought for, or is it the presidency that Bannon was attaching himself to? And if that's the case, was it even - were there any, really, successes to it? This is, I think, a problem of Steve Bannon - is that he inflates his own importance to Trump and sort of suggests that his own agenda is the same as Trump's. In many ways, they are the same - economic nationalism, sort of what gave rise to Donald Trump. But there's another side to Donald Trump, which is the side that Steve Bannon hates, which is the sort of - you can call it globalist. You can call it - the New Yorkers are the ones who are always criticized in the White House by the Steve Bannon types.", "Right.", "You know, I do think that the sort of economic nationalists are on their heels right now. They don't have anybody. They don't have anybody, really, who identifies with the broad conservative movement left in the White House or certainly the Republican Party, except for the vice president, Mike Pence.", "Moving on, though. What do you think is the significance of the slow break from Trump by Senate and House Republicans? Many are criticizing him by name now. We saw Bob Corker - very harsh this week. Does that have some real significance?", "I think it does. It's been a slow burn throughout the last - what? - seven and a half, eight months of the of the Trump presidency. I think Charlottesville accelerated that. This is a moment when, I think, Republicans who were, for whatever reason, giving the president the benefit of the doubt, thinking, well, at least we can get some of our agenda items through - you have the failure of the Obamacare repeal. You have the sense that it's chaos within the White House. And then you have this real sense that this could be affecting, in 2018, the elections.", "There are, I think, Republicans in the Senate - people like Bob Corker or whoever - who just simply reject the equivocation of Donald Trump. And it sort of offends them on a personal level. So all of that is sort of - now, I think, has been simmering maybe underneath the surface, to mix my metaphors. But now it's come up. And there's no sort of political - I should say there's less political upside to staying with President Trump. And there's more political upside, frankly, to distancing yourself from him, particularly as the 2018 elections heat up.", "What does he need to do to advance his agenda now that he has so few defenders in Congress? And he continues to criticize his own party.", "Well, I suppose there's a possibility he could find sort of a third way - right? - sort of break himself away from the Republican Party and just try to approach things from an independent, populist standpoint. There are some things on which he could possibly find, on the policy side, Democratic support. The problem is he just doesn't have any political support for that. There are - there was an opportunity at the beginning of the administration, I think, to do some sort of big infrastructure package. You could've peeled off Democrats like Joe Manchin or Joe Donnelly or Heidi Heitkamp. That's just impossible now. He's become so toxic not simply to Democrats but also to Republicans, as well.

And thanks very much for being with us today.", "Thanks for having me.", "First of all, as you point out in your piece, the word genocide has legal implications.", "Right. The word genocide's actually a very precise legal term that refers to the intent to wipe out, either in whole or part, a particular ethnic, religious, racial, group. I want to be clear in saying that I don't think that Darfur is genocide, as the piece makes clear. That's not saying that I don't think it's a horrific pattern of human rights abuses that demands a very serious response. In fact, part of the argument I'm making there is that we shouldn't have to call it genocide in order to try to mobilize people to act.", "But calling it genocide really runs against what the actual legal definition of genocide is, and it's for that reason that very few, if any, of the major human rights organizations have actually come out and called it genocide. It's been mainly politicians and activists that have adopted that label because they think it'll mobilize the public.", "Well, among them is the United States government. And the way it is usually portrayed - it is that, of course, all of these people are African but we're using different distinctions here, that basically Arab tribesmen and this militia known as the Janjaweed, which works in conjunction with the Sudanese government, has been unleashed on African villagers, partly because they support a rebellion, partly for various other reasons. But why doesn't that qualify for genocide?", "Well, you said partly because they support a rebellion. I don't think it's partly because they support a rebellion; I think what's going on in Darfur is a very brutal counter-insurgency campaign directed against the villages that support the rebels.", "I - there's clearly been animosities over time between Arabs and Africans, but in western Sudan, which is where Darfur is, there hasn't been this history of ethnic conflict. In fact, Alex de Waal, one of the people who knows the region best, has written about, you know, sort of the long-standing malleable nature of ethnic and other boundary lines there. There wasn't, as in Rwanda or in other places that we think of as being heavily conflicted ethnically, a long history of ethnic tension.", "It's much more political. It's much more directed towards the fact that the government there, just as it tried to do in the south and other parts of the country when it was facing an insurgency, has gone after the sea in which the rebels swim.", "And, as you say, the tactics are quite similar to what happened in southern Sudan during that very, very long conflict.", "Yeah, and two million people may have died in southern Sudan, which is part of my point is that by focusing on genocide we may be missing the fact that what we need to be responding to are gross human rights abuses, not to the labeling of a conflict as a genocide. And, as I say in the article, there are also other reasons why I think it's particularly problematic to choose that label.", "Well, one of the things you fear is that the use of the word genocide will, in fact, exacerbate tensions between the Arabs and the Africans who, at the end of the day, have to live together.", "Exactly. I mean, it's a mistake to believe that the Arab population, the Arab nomads and other groups that I identify with the Arab government in that region, aren't going to go away. They're going to be there, and peace in Darfur is going to require those population groups to come together. By declaring it a genocide, you've already set up a categorization that is going to make it hard for any of those groups to begin to sort of move beyond.", "I think that we ought to focus on the real perpetrators of the human rights abuses, which is the government of Sudan, not on some ethnic categorization. And there, as I mention in the article, one of the examples of the dangers of genocide rhetoric is what's going on in Rwanda. The - in Rwanda we had what was clearly a genocide. I don't think there's anybody that disputes that. But now we have a situation in which the government that came to power after that genocide, which is a minority government, basically uses genocide rhetoric to carry out - as Human Rights Watch has documented - an incredibly repressive political strategy.", "And so, once again, I mean, we've got to be careful of what the consequences of the rhetoric we use are.", "Would ethnic cleansing be a more appropriate term?", "Well I - Human Rights Watch - and I should be clear, I don't speak for Human Rights Watch anymore, I'm now a private attorney. I worked for Human Rights Watch for nine months on an interim basis during part of the Darfur debate. Human Rights Watch called it ethnic cleansing. Personally, I'm not even sure ethnic cleansing makes sense in the context. I think, as I said, I think it's a brutal counter-insurgency campaign.", "We've seen other counter-insurgency efforts. We could look at the situation in Angola, or quite frankly, look at Vietnam. People forget, a million people died - a million civilians died in the Vietnam conflict. Many of them as a result of U.S. activities designed to eliminate the villages and hamlets and the support that was coming from the peasants for the Viet Cong.", "So I - once again, I think it's - I would much rather focus on getting out of the naming game and also this even more important problem is if we're going to prevent genocide, or prevent gross human rights abuses, however we call them, what we've got to do is develop the capacity to respond early on in the cycle of conflict. One of the problems with genocide is that by the time something reaches the level at which there's even a genocide debate, it's already too late to prevent much of the suffering.", "And so I think we need, in a sense, a coalition to prevent human rights abuses as much as we need a coalition to stop genocide.", "Michael Clough is on the TALK OF THE NATION Opinion Page today. He's written an Op-Ed piece in The Los Angeles Times that argues that the use of the word genocide, as it relates to Darfur, is both inaccurate and counter-productive.", "This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "And let's get a listener involved. John(ph) is with us on the phone line. 800-989-8255 if you'd like to join us. John's in Jacksonville, Florida.", "Hi. I have a - first a statement and then a question for Mr. Clough. The word ethnic cleansing reminds me too much of an Orwellian term. It's basically newspeak - it's making a word, genocide, into something that's a little bit more palatable. And I was first alarmed in Bosnia when ethnic cleansing was used instead of genocide, and also in Rwanda I remember ethnic cleansing being used.", "I'm wondering - I mean, as far as I know, the term genocide is a systematic elimination of a race. Under the U.N. Charter, it's also my understanding that they are mandated to intervene if genocide is taking place. So I'm wondering, is this actually a systematic extermination of a race by another race? Is it genocide, and if it is, wouldn't the U.N. be mandated to intervene and stop it?", "John, that's an excellent question. In fact, you've actually gone right to the heart of the problem with the use of the term genocide in this context.", "One, it's now been, what, 20 months since people started to begin to call Darfur genocide. They did begin to call it, for exactly the reasons you've -genocide for exactly the reasons you cited. They thought it would mandate the international community to respond. The international community hasn't responded that way.", "So, in a funny way, one of the unfortunate lessons of this debate is that you created a public consensus called a genocide, and you established that the international community won't respond in the way that it is theoretically mandated to do. In fact, one of the great ironies is that the same day that Colin Powell said that the State Department had found that it was genocide, he also said, well, but it won't really change the direction of U.S. policy. And U.S. policy continues to be a much more nuanced policy than you would expect in response to genocide.", "Now, to go back to the question, I don't think that what's going on there is a systematic attempt to eliminate the African population. I think it's a systematic attempt to defeat the insurgency and the rebels, and that the solution is ultimately as we're seeing now, a political solution. Once there's either a political settlement or a change in government, I don't think that this is going to be a continuing conflict between Arabs and Africans, which is what the term genocide implies.", "John, thanks very much for the call.", "Thank you.", "Another thing you pointed out was that Darfur came to a lot of people's attention, not to say that it wasn't happening earlier, about the same time as the 10th Anniversary of Rwanda, and indeed, this was, in some people's minds, the new Rwanda…", "Right.", "…what was going on now. But even in Rwanda, where obviously things happened a lot quicker, but in Rwanda, that was clearly genocide and the international community did nothing about that either.", "Exactly. And that period in time I think is actually very instructive. I mean one of the reasons that I'm so concerned about the mischaracterization is that there's been a boom-bust cycle in activism concerned with Africa. And what people now forget is that the main reason the United States was so slow to respond in Rwanda, to what was clearly genocide, was because of the disaster in Somalia.", "In December of 1992, the old Bush administration made what was a generally applauded decision to intervene in Somalia. As we know, it turned out to be a disaster, (unintelligible) debate over why. But then the Clinton administration was forced to pull out of Somalia. Somalia is now - in fact, Somalia is coming back into the news this week because of continuing fighting. There's no state there.", "In that case, you had this exact same phenomenon. The activists rallied to humanitarian intervention in Somalia. It created a set of consequences that no one was prepared for.

And I have heard that perhaps there are fans for sale here, if you get here early enough to get one.", "Turns out my tip was a good one.", "Today we got a shipment in of both A/Cs and fans.", "Jorge Fresiado is a manager at Costco.

As Dorothy and Annette look on, more and more shoppers emerge with the object of their desire. A forty-inch tall tower fan that comes complete with a remote.", "Can I ask you a question? You have three fans there.", "Four.", "Four. Forty inch - you have 160 inches of fan here.", "Right. (laughs) I could use more.", "Finally, Dorothy and Annette and the others are granted entrance, as elite shoppers continue to carry out fan after fan. Since the guy at the door wouldn't accept my press pass as a membership card, I find a little patch of shade and wait for my new fan-seeking friends to emerge. Finally, I see Annette, she's empty handed. Wait, wait, wait, wait now I don't, I don't see you carrying a fan. Where's your fan?", "Those people who pay the fee for the business, they got them, and the inside employees got them.", "And there's none left for the folks like you and me?", "Oh no. No. Oh I know, we have hundreds of them, in Hawaii. Is that a bitch? (laughs)", "Well, here's an idea.

It's a special refugee program for Iraqis who assisted the U.S. military and other American organizations on the ground during the conflict. But the number of refugees admitted is declining rapidly. More than 7,000 Iraqis entered the U.S. through this program in fiscal year 2015. This year, as of last week, just 48. Now the Pentagon is voicing concerns to the White House over the drop in numbers, according to a new Reuters report. Officials argue that by not providing safety to people who risk their lives to help the U.S. military, it will be more difficult to win future cooperation from locals in Iraq and other conflict zones. Yeganeh Torbati wrote that story for Reuters. She joins us now. Welcome to the program.", "Thanks for having me.", "Tell us who these Iraqis are who are eligible for this program. What kind of work do they do?", "This program is open to Iraqis who worked for the U.S. military, for the U.S. embassy, for American contractors who worked in Iraq, for American news media who had a presence in Iraq and also for American non-governmental organizations who had a presence there.", "And when you say work with the military, what kind of thing would you be doing as a local Iraqi for the U.S. government?", "The most common task that I've come across is interpretation, but it's important to note that at least the interpreters that I've spoken to, often, their actual jobs went way beyond that. I spoke to one man who helped his U.S. Army supervisors navigate firefights, who helped introduce them to local influential government individuals or elders within different tribes. So really, you know their, tasks can run the gamut.", "What kind of danger are they in that leads them to apply for refugee status?", "Everything from actual assassination. That's happened many times, where people who were known to work with Americans have been killed and targeted specifically by militias who are opposed the American presence in Iraq. They can be kidnapped. And they can be ostracized from their villages and cities and communities.", "So there's always been a high threshold for this program, right? You have to be screened pretty intensely.", "Absolutely.", "What's changed why there's been a drop in the number of people admitted?", "So the Trump administration has instituted a number of changes to the refugee program since taking office in January 2017. It first did an outright ban on refugees in the first months of the administration, and then it required refugees to submit more information as part of their application. And so this meeting that I reported on that happened at the White House at which there were many officials from many different agencies, what was revealed at that meeting is that the way the FBI is conducting certain background checks that are required of Iraqi refugees, those checks are bringing up many more red flags than they were previously. And at that meeting, from the officials who have told me about sort of what transpired, it wasn't really clear to officials there exactly what may have changed in the FBI's screening methodology that, you know, wasn't the case before. And that's something that officials are going to be looking into a little bit more.", "So in your reporting, you're finding there are people in the Pentagon saying, look, whatever we can do to help this process along, we need you to help the people who helped us. What does the White House say to that?", "The White House says that the changes that we have made to the refugee program over the last year and a half are making Americans safer, that we vet refugees from Iraq or from any country more thoroughly than ever before.", "And that includes whether they helped us and whether they're applying in this special refugee program.", "Exactly. I think that the White House's emphasis is on the potential threat that's posed by refugees and not so much on the potential benefits, whether it's foreign policy benefits or whether it's - as some people in the Pentagon and throughout the administration would argue - the national security benefits that, you know, presenting a robust way for Iraqis to find safe haven after helping America presents.", "Yeganeh Torbati.

We should point out you're in New York and we're in Washington, so you can't see. We have brought today some packages from the grocery store. And I have one which may work. Clearly, here's an example. It's Nature's Promise chicken and it says right on the cover all natural. No antibiotics administered. Fat and all vegetable diet. No growth stimulants or hormones.", "Okay. The chicken wouldn't have hormones anyway, so that's a gratuitous statement and the rest of it you take on face value.

Right on the box it says 100 percent natural. Excellent source of whole grain.

Maybe it means that no artificial fibers had been added. It would be hard to know without seeing the ingredient list.", "Okay. Midway down the ingredient list - at least not at the top - is high fructose corn syrup.", "Right. Now is that natural or not? Ooh. That's a wonderful question. High fructose corn syrup is made by taking corn starch and using several kinds of enzymes in order to convert the starch to sugars, so that's an enzymatic process that does occur in nature. It occurs in your mouth, for example. I wouldn't call it natural if it's in the laboratory. So that's one of the points of debate. Would you consider something that's been treated with enzymes natural or not?", "Okay. Now here's another one and this is a cereal bar by Kellogg's Nutra Grain.

High pressure pasteurization. The food is sealed. High pressure is applied, and the bacteria are somewhat neutralized. What about that?", "Well, that's an extension of regular pasteurization. Regular pasteurization heats the - usually milk or juices - to a certain temperature for a certain period of time. And what the high pressure pasteurization allows it to do is to shorten the time because they do it at a higher temperature. I don't see that there's much different.", "So you're kind of okay with that?", "I'm okay with that one. I don't like bacteria in my juices or milk, so I'd just as soon have them pasteurized.", "You know, farm fresh, I mentioned earlier, used to be right from the farm and somebody's market -", "That's what I think of.

The prime minister refused, so a group of Islamic clerics took the cartoons and reportedly other more offensive depictions of the Prophet Muhammad to the Middle East and circulated them widely.

Michelle Richardson is a food technologist at the Natick Soldier Systems Center outside of Boston. She helped create the pizza and joins us now. Welcome to the program.", "Thank you.", "What is so tough about creating an MRE pizza?", "I think it's tough because the pizza is made up of different components. It has sauce, cheese, pepperoni. And then it has the crust. And they have different amounts of water. And so what happens is when - water likes to move and be equal in all parts. So if you had a crust that has a little bit of water and you put sauce on it that has a lot of water, then the water from the sauce is going to move to the crust, making it soggy. And the eating quality is not going to be there.", "I mean, that can be easily solved with a very hot oven, you know, for a fresh pizza. But this pizza, this MRE pizza, has to withstand - what? - something like freezing floods, blazing heat, maybe even a 10-story drop to the ground. And it's got to last for how long? - 36 months?", "Yup - 36 months at 80 degrees Fahrenheit without refrigeration.", "OK. Well, explain to us how a soldier would prepare it.", "He can eat it as is. All the MREs come with a flameless ration heater. So if he decides that he wants to have a hot pizza, he can actually heat it up. In less than 10 minutes, he'll have a hot piece of pizza.", "Of course, the key thing here is the taste. And I have to say I looked on YouTube and saw a critique of the pizza (laughter).

How does it taste? And they ask - we actually ask them for ratings. And for the most part, it always has gotten high marks.", "So how much of that is psychological or context? - which - when a soldier is hunkered down someplace and bites into his or her pizza, it probably tastes sublime, given where they might be.", "Actually, this pizza taste very close to the pizza that you eat. But I think that when a soldier's out in the field, they don't expect the pizza to taste like they would get from a local pizzeria.

What are your limits?", "Well, we really don't have limits because we're always looking for innovative technology. But they do like a lot of desserts. And so we're currently looking at a technology that will dry a cheesecake down so that it would last longer, number one, and that it won't be as heavy.

It includes President Trump's offer to extend protections for DACA recipients for three years. And in exchange, he would get the $5.7 billion he wants for a border wall.", "That alone had Democrats calling the deal a nonstarter before it was even written. But it also adds $12.7 billion for natural disaster relief. This is something Democrats have pushed for. So could that sweeten the deal here?", "Well, let's ask that question, among others, to NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Hi, Mara.", "Hi, David.", "All right, so tell us more about what's in this bill that the Senate's going to be taking a vote on.", "Well, the bill has disaster relief in it, as you said, as a sweetener. And the big question is, could this proposal of the president's that will be on the Senate floor bring us any closer to the end of the shutdown? And it could. I don't think it's the final deal. But the president is now talking the language of compromise. He's come off the notion that the wall has to be 2,000 miles long. He's added relief for the DREAMers, young people brought here, sometimes illegally, by their parents.", "This is not the final deal. Democrats would need more. Trump has not said how much less money for the wall he's willing to take than $5.7 billion. But the first step is to see if this can get 60 votes on the Senate floor. Democrats say it can't. But then they'll have to keep talking.", "Will they have to keep talking? I mean, so far Democrats have basically said to the president, we're not going to talk, at least publicly saying, we're not going to talk until you open the government. But - but you think this is a window. I mean, Democrats are going to be forced to actually start negotiating and getting to some of the nitty gritty here.", "Yes, I do. I think that usually, in the past, when we've had these standoffs, there's a mechanism where the government is reopened week by week. They have to keep on voting while they keep on talking. Vice President Pence said on television yesterday this wasn't a final offer. He said the legislative process is a negotiation. That sounded so normal.", "(Laughter).", "But I do think you're going to hear more from Democrats about their vision of border security. If the argument is about border security, the president wins. If it's about a wall, the Democrats win. And I think that they are going to start talking more about their vision of what they want on the border.", "Mara, can I ask you more about what the president was offering on this - the DACA protection for three years? Because, I mean, most Republicans have been standing by him through this and supporting this deal. But some of his supporters are calling that DACA offer amnesty. Could that hurt him with part of his base?", "Well, that's always the big question. I think right now Republicans in Congress are pretty united behind him. And yes, the and cultures of the world, radio talk show hosts, are calling this amnesty. But Republicans in Congress want the government open because they're being blamed for the shutdown, so far more than Democrats are. Republicans I've talked to say that Trump's hold on his base is firm enough that he probably could get some relief for the DREAMers in here.", "The big question is, could he go all the way to a path to citizenship, which is going to be hard since that's been defined as amnesty by the vice president? Where is the sweet spot? How much less money could he get for the wall, and how much deportation relief would he have to offer for the DREAMers?", "Many questions to answer as we go forward and as that partial government shutdown for now continues. NPR's Mara Liasson. Thank you, Mara.", "Thank you.", "Let's talk more about this shutdown. More than 50,000 TSA employees have been working without pay since the partial government shutdown began over a month ago now.", "Yeah, and they're getting help from some unusual corners. Members of the band Kiss have been offering them free food at airport locations of their restaurant, which is called Rock and Brews. Here's Kiss band member Paul Stanley in a Facebook video.", "While the TSA continues to work on our behalf without pay, we want to make sure that we can at least provide them with a delicious meal to show our support.", "But more and more TSA workers are actually just calling out sick altogether, as many as 1/10 this past Sunday. TSA released a statement saying that many of those employees said they can't get to work because of financial limitations.", "Let's talk to NPR's David Schaper in Chicago. He's been covering this. Hi there, David.", "Good morning.", "So it's amazing. As I've been going through airports and going through security lines, it seems like every passenger says to a TSA employee, like, thank you for working without pay. And it sounds like it's now getting to a point where more and more are having to call out sick. What are they telling you about this decision?", "Well, as you guys just said, they're not actually saying (imitating cough) I'm sick; I can't come in. They're really not able to go in because of the financial limitations. You know, working without pay for a TSA employee is a difficult thing because they're among the lowest paid federal government employees. They make about 35 to $43,000 a year on average. That's about 17 to 20 bucks an hour.", "So a lot of them live just paycheck to paycheck or do just a little bit better than that. And so while the vast majority are still working their shifts, more and more of them are saying they've got to go do something else to make a little more cash. They've got to put food on the table.", "So they're going to pick up work elsewhere, working odd jobs, waiting tables, whatever they can find. Or they'll stay home, stay home with the kids so a spouse can pick up extra shifts or so they just don't have that extra expense of childcare during the day.", "So a lot of hard decisions, obviously, the shutdown clearly disrupting life for them, their families. What impact is this or could this have on travel and airports if this goes on?", "Well, at this point we're not seeing, you know, flights canceled, flight delays and people missing flights. But we are starting to see more and more airports closing security checkpoints because of a shortage of screeners and lines getting longer at certain airports. You know, there - there were a bunch of extra screeners added to airports in Atlanta, at LaGuardia in New York, at the Newark Airport.", "There were long lines, apparently, over the weekend in New Orleans, at Baltimore-Washington Airport because they had closed checkpoints. Houston's had some problems. It depends on the airport and how many employees in that - in that particular area are calling in. But it hasn't just grown to that point yet of where we're going to see canceled flights and huge disruptions to air travel.", "Is it just airport security employees? Or are there other employees at airports who are impacted by the shutdown?", "No, actually the FAA has hundred - has thousands of inspectors, technicians and safety specialists who inspect the planes, who, you know, do everything from licensing pilots to making sure that the air traffic control equipment is working properly. And they are working without pay. A lot of them weren't actually considered safety critical and essential employees when the shutdown began.", "But a lot of them got called back to work last week and are on the job now. But they're going to have the same sort of financial troubles soon if they have to to keep working and keep doing these important jobs without pay. And that's where the ripple effect could come, where - where air travel could be affected.", "NPR's David Schaper, talking to us from Chicago. David, thanks.", "My pleasure.", "All right, now we want to talk about the political turmoil in Venezuela and what's looking like an uncertain future for that country's leader.", "Yeah, officers in the National Guard in Venezuela basically went rogue and posted a video on social media early Monday morning.", "(Speaking Spanish).", "So in this video they are calling people to the streets to support their uprising against the president, Nicolas Maduro. The attempt is the latest in a whole string of calls to remove Maduro from power. The Venezuelan president was sworn into his second term earlier this month. But many, including the United States, have called Maduro's government illegitimate. He faces an opposition-run congress that is calling for the military to turn against him.", "And NPR's Philip Reeves is in Caracas covering all of this. And Phil, start if you can by telling us exactly what unfolded here yesterday.", "Well, it's not entirely clear. The authorities say that in the early hours, a group of National Guardsmen in Caracas took a police captain hostage, travelled across town in several military trucks, kidnapped four more officers, raided an outpost, stole a bunch of weapons and then were captured after some sort of confrontation just before that - that video was posted online calling on people to abandon Maduro. And other videos appeared too. And now the government says that 27 guardsmen have been arrested and will face what they describe as the full weight of the law.", "Well, talk to me about the broader political situation here because while this was members of the National Guard, some officers who turned against him, Maduro is focusing his criticism on congress, saying congress is trying to destabilize the country. What exactly is he talking about?", "Yeah, congress, or the National Assembly, as it's called here, is opposition-controlled. And it's long been opposed to Maduro and the ruling Socialist Party. In fact, Maduro and the party have stripped it of all its powers. But now it's launching a new drive to oust him, arguing that his second term, which has just begun, is illegitimate because it was the result of a fraudulent election.", "And in this, the National Assembly has the support of the U.S. and dozens of other countries who are also stepping up pressure right now on Maduro. And the National Assembly also has a new young leader. He's 35, Juan Guaido. And he has said that he's willing to be an interim president for a transitional period leading to new elections if the public supports that and, crucially, if the military supports that.", "Phil, I mean, we've talked about with you how hard it has been for people in Venezuela. This country has been through so much economic turmoil of late. I mean, how shaky is this political moment? Could Maduro lose his grip on power? And could there be a real period of chaos and uncertainty going forward?", "Well, the country is in terrible shape. But remember, Maduro still controls the supreme court. He still appears to have the support of the top military command. And he still has the all-powerful legislature that he created last year, the constituent assembly, which is packed with his supporters. He still has that at his disposal.", "But things do appear to be moving. The opposition's called for a nationwide day of protest on Wednesday. They're expecting a big turnout. We'll have to see.

The U.S. air campaign in Iraq and Syria has been underway for several weeks, yet little is clear about what effect it's having. NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman is here to fill us in on what is known. And Tom, first, what's the extent of the strikes so far?", "Well, Melissa, we're approaching 400 airstrikes so far in Iraq and Syria. The vast majority - roughly three quarters of all the airstrikes since they started in the summer have been in Iraq. And if you look at Iraq, most of the airstrikes have been to protect the Mosul dam in northern Iraq. It's what's called critical infrastructure because is supplies both water and power. And there've also been a lot of airstrikes around the northern city or Erbil. We have U.S. soldiers and diplomats working - hundreds of them, and the U.S. wanted to prevent that city from being overrun by Islamic State fighters.", "And then still another location for the airstrikes in Iraq was Sinjar Mountain, of course. That's where there was a potential humanitarian catastrophe in the summer with the Yazidi religious sect.", "OK, so those targets that you're talking about are all inside Iraq. What about in Syria?", "Well, in Syria roughly - just over 100 airstrikes so far - a lot of them around an area north-central Syria, the city of Raqqah, which is kind of the de facto headquarters for the Islamic State. The goal here in Syria is to cut off supplies - the supply line from Syria into Iraq. That's where we've heard a lot of talk about them hitting makeshift oil refineries, supply depots, military equipment trucks, headquarters - again, trying to stem the movement of those supplies and even fighters into Iraq.", "What about the bomb damage assessment in Syria, Tom? We haven't heard a whole lot about that. What have you heard?", "Well, you're not hearing too much. And now remember, the first night of the bombing they talked about targeting this group most people never heard of - the Khorasan group, a terrorist group officials say were planning to attack either the U.S. or Europe. We kept seeing pictures of damaged buildings at the Pentagon. We were told they were finance centers, command centers, key people were being targeted.", "But the problem is there aren't good sources on the ground to verify some of this stuff and talk about it like reporters or independent observers - even communications with fighters are limited. So we don't really have a good sense of the effects of the airstrikes. But what we do know, however, is that ISIS is still on the move in places in Iraq just west of Baghdad, and in Syria, places like Kobani along the border with Syria and Turkey.", "Right, and Thomas, as we mentioned earlier, ISIS appears to be close to capturing Kobani inside Syria, and there have been complaints that the U.S. has not been doing enough to try to protect that town - keep the ISIS forces at bay. What you learning about that?", "You're right. There were no airstrikes for a time. That's changed. Just in the last two days, the U.S. and coalition have launched about a dozen airstrikes to push back Islamic State fighters, but it's not clear why there was a delay. The U.S. was kind of just holding back. The town is inside of the Turkish border, so there's a sense that the U.S. had hoped the Turks would go in militarily and push back Islamic forces. That did not happen. So now the U.S. is launching the strikes, but there's still fighting in and around the town of Kobani. Now, the Pentagon - and we've heard Secretary of State John Kerry downplay the significance of this now. They say listen, it's not a strategic location - not a big city like Mosul in Iraq.", "Tom, as you talk to military planners - analysts, what do they say would change the dynamic in Iraq and Syria? Would airstrikes alone be enough to make a difference?", "No. Nobody thinks that. What you need is a competent ground force both in Syria and in Iraq. The problem is in Syria, you really don't have any ground forces to speak of. Small Kurdish forces in Syria are fighting. And in Iraq, we're told that half of the Iraqi Army units just aren't ready to fight.

That's Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido. Pence and Guaido met after a dramatic weekend on the Venezuelan border with Colombia. Volunteers tried to bring food and medicine into the country. The military shot and killed at least four people. Two aid trucks were torched. Many people were tear-gassed.", "Today Pence and Guaido called on Venezuela's military to join the opposition. They hinted at military intervention if the military refuses. Reporter John Otis is in Bogota and joins us now. Hi, John.", "Hi, Ari.", "This weekend's actions by Juan Guaido seem to be a big gamble, trying to get aid across the border in hopes that there would be mass defections from the military. Those defections did not materialize. So what did he and the U.S. vice president suggest could be the next move here?", "Well, when the two men met, Pence suggested that it may very well be a long, hard slog to bring about regime change in Venezuela. Pence announced some new sanctions against four Venezuelan state governors who the U.S. blames for promoting some of the violence over the weekend. He said more sanctions would be announced. And he also said that the U.S. hasn't given up on moving food and medicine into Venezuela and that they're studying some new areas along the border where they might try again.", "But Pence also came out with some carrots. He urged Venezuelan military officials who are propping up Maduro to turn against his government and take up Juan Guaido's longstanding offer of amnesty. Over the weekend, about 150 officers and soldiers did defect. However, you know, as you mentioned, there weren't the massive military defections that Guaido's people were hoping for.", "OK, so one big question hanging over all of this is will the U.S. take military actions to bring about regime change in Venezuela. What did Vice President Pence have to say about that today?", "He said he hopes military force isn't necessary but that it remains an option. Now, this is something the Trump administration has been saying for a long time. So it wasn't really an escalation in rhetoric. Pence did make some quite interesting comments about Colombia, which borders Venezuela and was the launching point for that failed aid convoy. And let's listen to what he said.", "Colombia is our strongest partner in the region. And any who would threaten her sovereignty or security would do well not to test the commitment to our ally or the resolve of the United States of America.", "What Pence seems to be saying there is that the U.S. could be drawn into a conflict with Venezuela should there be any kind of major cross-border incidents with Colombia. And, you know, as we saw over the weekend, it's not that hard to imagine something like that happening.", "Pence is not the only foreign leader in Bogota today. There are also dozens of representatives of other countries backing Juan Guaido, including other Latin American countries. What's the broader feeling about the prospect of military intervention in Venezuela?", "Latin American diplomats are saying that they're open to things like tougher sanctions. Pence wants them to, for example, restrict visas to Maduro officials, to confiscate state oil company assets in their countries, to close off their banking systems. But even before today's meetings, Latin American leaders - including the vice president of Brazil - were explicitly ruling out military intervention in Venezuela.", "You know, right now there's a lot of unity in many parts of the world in terms of backing Guaido and isolating Maduro. And so there's a danger that this solidarity could break apart if there's a major push, either from within the Venezuelan opposition or the U.S. - or from some other country - to send in troops.", "And so what is Guaido's next move here?", "Well, Guaido's in a tough position. He has a lot of international support but no real power. In fact, it's unclear whether Maduro's even going to let him back into Venezuela. There are efforts to open up negotiations with the Maduro government for a peaceful transfer of power.

Do you think this will change attitudes about the flag in places where it's still looked upon with pride?", "I don't - well, it will not change attitudes of those who look upon it with pride as a rule.

As we mentioned, from March through May of 2006, mass immigration protests were held throughout the U.S. Some 500,000 people rallied in Los Angeles. All in all, protest and rallies were held in 140 cities and 39 states. So we wondered just what is the legacy of those marches on March 1, 2006? We've invited several guests to talk about that.", "Jose Antonio Vargas has become one of the most visible voices among activists seeking a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented. Fermin Vasquez is a DREAMer. He was brought to the U.S. without authorization when he was a child, and he helped organize the 2006 march in Los Angeles. And we're also joined by Jessica Vaughan. She's director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that advocates a more restrictive immigration policy. And I welcome you all, and thank you so much for being here.", "Thank you for having us.", "Oh, thank you for having us.", "So let me start with your memories from 2006, if that's OK. Fermin, you were just a teenager. Do you remember what gave you the idea to help organize the marches at that age?", "It was the first time I had come out to a march. And I did so because I thought it was important for young people like myself and my family to come out and - you know, not only to be heard but also to be seen on the streets. You know, you had folks promoting the march on the radio, on the streets, flyers, on social media. So it was a very vibrant march and a vibrant movement that was forming. But it was in response to the anti-immigrant legislation at that time.", "So Jose Antonio Vargas, what about you? When the 2006 marches happened, you were still not out about being undocumented. And in fact, I've heard you say that coming out of the closet as a gay man was less daunting than coming out as undocumented. So I was wondering back in 2006 when you were still not out, what was it like for you watching those marches?", "Well, actually, I was at The Washington Post. And, like, as someone who is undocumented but in the closet about it and not wanting to talk about it, I just really did not want anything to do with it. And I'm embarrassed to say that now by the way because I remember what a wake-up call that was. I mean, I have - you know, having grown up in the Bay Area in California, I mean, this was in many ways the first real visible flexing of muscle of the Latino community - not only the undocumented community but our U.S. citizen, you know, relatives, right? I mean, it showed how integrated undocumented people are in American life. What the marches did was start something which we have not been able to stop in the past few years, which is more and more undocumented people coming out in all facets of life.", "Jessica, what about you? Do you remember - as I mentioned, you're looking at this from a very different perspective. Do you remember where you were and what you were doing in 2006? Do you remember if you had any reaction to those marches at that time?", "Yes, I do. In 2006, I was working at the Center for Immigration Studies. So these protests were of interest, of course. But to me, it - they seemed pretty irrelevant to the policy debate at the time, except to the extent that they served to maybe harden views on both sides. You know, I really don't think the marches have made much of a difference in policy terms.", "Since they're still going on 10 years later and we still haven't seen policies enacted that the participants in the marches want to see, you know, I think it's pretty clear that they have not been effective in achieving comprehensive immigration reform.", "While they may have felt empowering to the people who took part, there were also people who had a negative reaction to these marches and were upset by the Mexican flags being flown. And, you know, of course - you know, that was a big strategic error on the part of the protesters that they haven't repeated since. People told them, like, look, you know, it doesn't do any good to march through the streets flying the flags of other countries if what you tell people that you're wanting is to become part of America.", "So, you know, I think there was actually some backlash as a result of the marches. And that persists today, where for a lot of people the marches are a symbol of our continued failure to enforce immigration laws.", "Immigration has always been polarizing in this country. And a lot has been said about the tone of the conversation right now. What does each of you think needs to happen to move the conversation forward from this point? Jose, do you want to start?", "Well, I would actually argue, you know, since coming out five years ago, I have done more than 600 events in 48 states across the country. The conversation is moving forward. It's moving forward in smaller communities, right, in all these different states. It's not moving forward nationally. But I think what I've realized is once people hear stories, once people hear facts, once people actually face you, right, there's a conversation that starts that moves people intellectually and emotionally.", "And I'm personally - you know, our work is focusing on that - on moving that - instead of doing the same old, same old D.C. conversation that happens...", "OK.", "It doesn't get us anywhere.", "Jessica, what do you think needs to happen going forward? Because it's clear that - you know, that really it seems to be kind of in stasis right now. What do you think needs to happen to get the conversation moving forward?", "Well, I want to say, first of all, that for me personally, the issue has never been that I didn't know that there were people like Jose and other hard-working, intelligent, motivated people who were here illegally who wanted to be able to stay. I've met Jose in person and many others who are involved in this movement and been very impressed with their dedication and their intelligence and motivation. That's not the problem.", "You need to do more than just march in the streets and chant. What you need to do is make a compelling case for your policy objectives. And that's really what's lacking. And so to move forward, what we need to do is get to a point with immigration enforcement where people are satisfied that the laws we have are going to be enforced and that any amnesty or expansion of immigration is not going to just provide more incentive for people to come here illegally. And it's only when we get to that point that people believe our immigration system has integrity that we can talk about an amnesty or changing the categories that we have.", "OK, Fermin, what about you? I'm going to give you the final word here, brief final word. What do you think needs to happen to get this conversation moving forward?", "For me, I think that we're stronger when we recognize the humanity of other people. We are stronger where we embrace other cultures and other people coming into our country. I think that's what's made America great. We are going to continue to march. We're marching for hope, not hate. We're marching to be recognized in this country and build a future based not on fear but on hope, a future based not on hate but on love. And that's our message to the American public that we're - this is our country. We're here to stay, and we contribute every day.", "All right, well, thank you for that. Thank you all so much for joining us. It was a rich conversation. We just heard from Fermin Vasquez. He's communications specialist for SEIU. He joined us from his home in Los Angeles earlier. We heard from Jose Antonio Vargas. He's the founder of Define American. It's a nonprofit organization which advocates for immigrants to tell their stories. He's also in Los Angeles.

Scott Simon speaks with UCLA Professor of Urban Planning Mike Manville about the state of America's subways.", "utt": ["It's been a tough summer for subway riders. Summer Of Hell some headlines have called it. The 112-year-old system in New York has been plagued by increasing delays, frustration and political finger pointing, which in New York, of course, is often the middle finger. Washington, D.C.'s metro system just completed a year-long series of maintenance surges to improve safety, but delays continue. Subway and rail transit in Boston, Chicago and San Francisco have also been plagued by service outages, delays, breakdowns and grousing from passengers. Mike Manville is a professor of planning at UCLA. Professor, thanks for being with us.", "Sure.", "Is something going on? Why are all these subway systems seeming to come apart at the same time?", "Well, there's no nationwide single cause. You know, these are all separate systems of course. I think that there's probably two things going on. In some of these systems, part of the delay is not a result of maintenance problems, but sort of the services being victims of their own success.", "You know, a big problem that's happening in New York is simply that ridership is at something close to an all-time high. And the more people who a ride a subway, the more time it takes for people to get on and off. And so delays start to add up. That's not the case in some of these other cities where ridership is maybe growing but not growing as fast.", "But I think that the common thread in a lot of these cities is just that these systems are old. The systems are old and maintenance has been deferred on them. And, you know, in different ways and at different times, that's starting to catch up.", "So it's part of the crumbling infrastructure problem in America?", "(Laughter) Yeah, you could say that. I mean, I think that, you know - and certainly, when you think about it, these are some of the oldest pieces of infrastructure we have. Often when we talk about the crumbling infrastructure, folks are worried about our highway system or our bridges and so forth. But as you said, New York subway system is 112 years old. Boston's is even older. The rail system in San Francisco is also quite old. So this is some of the oldest infrastructure we have. And so it's not that surprising that it's starting to give out.", "It's a special kind of horror to be delayed for, let's say, even half an hour or even five minutes, for that matter, in a subway car that's stalled that has no electricity that's well underneath the ground and the air is stifling. And that - just the fear of that happening is enough to drive people away, isn't it?", "Absolutely. And I think, honestly, it would drive more people away from some of these systems except that, in a couple of these cities, a lot of the folks who ride the subway - that really is the only option. If you're in New York or even in parts of downtown Boston or parts of downtown Chicago, switching over to driving is extremely expensive.", "And it also gets in the way of what's an important but also largely overlooked role of public transit in the United States, which is that it's an important social service. Particularly once you get outside of the New York cities and Bostons of the world, transit riders are disproportionately low-income. And this is a way that we move around people who can't afford the typical way of moving around for an American, which is owning a private automobile.", "Yeah. Any one or two things you'd like to recommend, professor?", "If we look to some other countries, you know - and London is a good example. London has been - has really been dramatically working to upgrade its own system, which is as old - actually, older than New York's. One thing London did that I think, ultimately, a lot of American cities are going to have to at least wrestle with is that they started charging drivers for the congestion they cause.", "And that those two things. One is that simply charging people to drive at busy times and in busy places accomplishes a goal that a lot of people want transit to accomplish but that transit can't accomplish, which is reduce traffic congestion. But it also generates a lot of money from a broad base. And some of that, not even all of it, some of that can go into upgrading the transportation system.", "Mike Manville, who's a professor of urban planning at UCLA, thanks so much for being with us today.", "Yeah, my pleasure."], "speaker": ["SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "MIKE MANVILLE", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "MIKE MANVILLE", "MIKE MANVILLE", "MIKE MANVILLE", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "MIKE MANVILLE", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "MIKE MANVILLE", "MIKE MANVILLE", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "MIKE MANVILLE", "MIKE MANVILLE", "SCOTT SIMON, HOST", "MIKE MANVILLE"], "snorkel_label": [-1, -1, 0, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]}

And if so, where do you think the line should be drawn?", "I think the Republicans do the country a disservice when they throw Social Security and Medicare together under the term the entitlement programs. And the seniors that I see in Rhode Island who haven't had a cola in two years, who are living on an average of about $14,000 a year from Social Security, they really can't bear much more of a burden.

Is it possible that a compromise might happen without all the Democrats on board?", "I think that that is possible, and it's also possible that a compromise could fail and not get through the Senate because it doesn't have enough Democrats on board.

You know, and keep in mind that his predecessor, Sergey Kislyak, became, you know, if not a household name but close to it because of the Russia-gate scandals.", "Certainly, a man about town here in Washington, meeting with just about everybody, it seemed.", "Exactly. But towards the end of his tenure there, he really was sort of toxic. He couldn't meet anybody in the sort of American establishment - political establishment - without being outed by the press. And now Antonov says he wants to kind of change that. He wants to travel the country, engage Americans. He also says he's a big fan of jazz and country music. So, hopefully, he'll get to a club or two.", "(Laughter) OK. So he's got that going for him here in Washington. We do - against this backdrop, I just want to mention Russian President Putin has been in China. He met with President Xi last night. They talked North Korea. They apparently talked about how to deal with North Korea. Do we know what they may have agreed?", "Well, the two met last time in July in Moscow. And they've been pushing a de-escalation deal for the Korean Peninsula, the idea here being that the North Koreans would suspend their ballistic missile program, and the U.S. and South Korea would put a moratorium on military drills. Now, obviously, none of that's happened. Both sides have continued to push forward. But that's Russia's main message here - is kind of dialogue.", "Putin was in China. He said that threats are a road to nowhere. And it's important to note that Russia is also coming out against further sanctions against North Korea. Today, the deputy foreign minister said that they'd reached the limit of their impact and would just essentially break the North Korean economy. So, you know, it looks as though the Russians are essentially pushing for dialogue.", "All right.

Nice to talk to you again.", "First, to that vote on Don't Ask, Don't Tell. There was a lot of talk about President Obama, you know, fading into irrelevancy after the Republican victory in November. But since then, he's had two major legislative successes; this one, and of course, the tax deal.", "He certainly has. And I think, you know, there've been almost a fazzle(ph) degree of comparisons with Bill Clinton's comeback after the 1994 Republican sweep led by Newt Gingrich. This seems to me different in both a sort of temporal way and a strategic way.", "The temporal way is this is happening much faster for Barack Obama. It took several months after the election for the Clinton administration to sort of regain its footing. And the other is I think a difference in the way the Obama administration is approaching this, that Bill Clinton was famous for his triangulation, which you could think of as sort of taking some points from the other side's playbook and getting them and making them your own.", "And what strikes me is that what we've seen both with the tax cut bill and now with the Don't Ask, Don't Tell, is Obama's longtime identity as a conciliator or a mediator or somebody who believes above all to bring people together is the point of what he's doing in office.", "Now, we don't know whether that will apply in the next Congress when the Republicans control the House and the showdown over the government funding bill, which actually was blocked from Senate considerations, suggests some difficulties. But it has been impressive both in the timing and in the style of mind and governing that the president's reveal that it's happened this quickly.", "I know the thing that came out of the administration this week, Jim, was the Afghanistan review. It seemed to suggest a whole lot of paradoxes that success there depends on cooperation from forces and things that the U.S. can't really control.", "I think if you read only the administration's own documents, no outside criticism, no press report, you would see a very, very difficult situation, both intellectually and also practically.", "On the one hand, the administration says that success depends on cooperation of Pakistan. Without the intelligence support for groups who are operating in Pakistan, et cetera, then the effort in Afghanistan can't succeed, and also depends on what used to be called hearts and minds efforts of having Afghanistan people feel loyal to their government and to welcome rather than resist the presence of foreign troops. And so it says those two things are necessary, but also there is either very little progress or backward progress on both of them.", "In other words, success isn't happening - it depends on Pakistan, and actually, success can't happen. That's the message.", "I think there is an irresistible force and immovable object-type message that comes from the administration's reports. On the one hand, it says that \"success\" in Afghanistan is necessary and imperative. On the other hand, it's saying that it's probably impossible.", "So I guess the big test will come next spring when the administration has to decide, as its pledged, how many troops to withdraw.", "Yes. I think that how the administration can plausibly convince both its own party, the Democrats, and Republicans who are sort of prone to criticize the Democratic administration for weakness militarily, that it has a sustainable path ahead. It's, I think, the next big public presentation, both a decision the president will have to make in the way he explains it to us.", "Jim, in the context of Afghanistan, I think we'd be remiss if we didn't mention Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy and legendary diplomat who of course died this week.", "I think the tone that has come through a lot of the appreciations and assessments of him is that while we normally think of international affairs being affected by longtime historical trends and economic rises, falls and all the rest, the things that he accomplished showed how much could depend on a single person and his diplomatic skill and his vision and his ability to cajole and bully and persuade and charm. And in immediate term, it's going to be a big difference in Afghanistan policy the United States can no longer rely on Richard Holbrooke.

You know, I don't think the horses can really see the fire, but they know what's going on. They know that there's danger. And he was quite hysterical.

There's been some chaos to it...", "Yeah.", "...For certain.", "How do you get a pony out of the vineyard and into a truck?", "People go armed with treats and halters, and so they're able to catch them. And, you know, mostly, if you're calm, the horses stay calm.", "Horses eat a lot, don't they? How do you care for every one?", "Sure thing. Well, many of us were able to grab hay and some supplies as we were evacuating our barn. So we came with food and some items in hand. But the local seed stores have been donating all kinds of hay and shavings and pellets. So we have had, again, tremendous support from the local community, making sure that every horse here is fed.", "Can you smell the smoke, see the fire?", "There - while we cannot see the fire any longer from where we are, and it's very, very smoky. There's a ton of ash. There has been a ton of ash. Everyone's lungs are, you know, feeling constricted. The dogs are coughing because it's so thick in the air. So the scene itself is still dismal, for sure.", "But people are helping each other.", "People are coming together. You know, when there's an emergency like this, if the fire happens too fast and you can't get out in time, you have to set the horses free.", "Well, you got to put halters on, you got to label them. Those can burn off in a fire, so we actually handwrote with a Sharpie pen on all of our horses hooves the phone number. If there is some marking on the horse on - with ink, then we can identify, at least, who to call to find out where the horse will eventually need to be, or to let that person know that we have that horse.", "How do you fill your days there - all these people and horses staying at the fairgrounds?", "We're caring for other people's animals.

Ari Shavit is a columnist and reporter for Israel's Haaretz newspaper. He's been reporting on the man best positioned to unseat him - Isaac Herzog. He's a cochair of the Zionist Union, a center left block that has emerged as a primary rival to Netanyahu's Likud Party. Shavit says Herzog is appealing to Israelis for a number of reasons, including his impeccable family pedigree.", "Mr. Herzog's grandfather was Israel's first chief rabbi. His father was Israel's president. His uncle was the legendary Foreign Minister Abba Eban. And it goes on and on. And yet, Mr. Herzog is a very surprising presidential candidate. So what we've seen in the last few months is really the real surprise rise of Mr. Herzog from a nice guy effective, efficient but really not a presidential figure into a real national leader.", "Why is this so? I mean, what is he running on? What is his platform? What has so endeared him to a segment of the Israeli population?", "Let's begin with Mr. Herzog's weaknesses. He's not a general. He's not a war hero. Unlike many of our previous leaders, he's not the kind of macho, national figure. He's not very tall. His voice is not very deep. He's not very charismatic. And therefore, what he offers this nation, which is quite striking, is a completely new kind of leadership. The secret of Mr. Herzog is that he's really a kind of 21st century leader in the sense that he works with networks. Throughout the years, he crisscrossed the country time and time again, and he built support among many people who are very different from him. And in this sense, his candidacy brings something new of the kind of multicultural, multi-tribal Israel.", "You have outlined some very significant stylistic differences that he has with Netanyahu and past leaders of Israel. But let's talk a little bit more about the substance. What is his platform? There are some very important issues on the table right now for Israel. Where does he come down on those?", "He definitely comes from the center left. But he comes from the center of the center left. So he wants peace. He would try to pursue peace. But he's a realistic. And he sees - he's aware of the failures of the previous peace attempts. First step in an interview I had with him just a few weeks ago, he said should he be elected, his first action would be try to meet President Obama and to open a new page in the relationship between Israel and the United States.", "His second step would be to go to Egypt to meet the Egyptian president and try to have the Egyptian moderate Sunnis have influence on the Palestinians so some sort of new kind of peace process can be created; one that builds an alliance between America, Israel, the moderate Arabs and the moderate Palestinians so we can gradually move forward.", "Benjamin Netanyahu is running for his third consecutive term. He clearly has a lot of support among the Israeli population. Why is that? Why does he have such staying power? And why hasn't the left been able to produce a viable alternative?", "Until the end of 2014, Netanyahu was perceived as a prime minister that was not very loved by many people. Even his supports were not enthusiastic about him. And yet, he was perceived as the only presidential figure in the country. The reason for that is a threefold answer - stability, stability, stability. Mr. Netanyahu managed to keep - maintain strategic stability with no wars or no people getting killed on a large scale while the region was chaotic. He managed to keep the economy booming while the world was going through an economic crisis. And he managed to keep - maintain political stability within Israel's dysfunctional political system.", "That changed with the Gaza war of last summer because suddenly the strategic stability disappeared, people did get killed, the economy is not doing as well as it used to, and his political coalition collapsed. So his stability factor disappeared. And what you see now is growing resentment towards Mr. Netanyahu.

So how did you get interested in this subject?", "I kind of started by thinking about my own teenage years. I went through a lot, and I wanted to tap into those emotions for a film. And my next train of thought was how different it must be to be a teenager today when so much of your life is lived through a screen, and everything you do is documented on social media. And I just started exploring things in that world. And I found what you see in the film, which are meet and greets. And once I looked up what a meet and greet was, it kind of all came out of that.", "OK, so meet and greets play a big role in this. I guess there are meet and greets for all kinds of influencers. But for these boy broadcasts, right, they play a particular role. What is that?", "So essentially, these girls are watching these boys all day, every day. But they can - this could go on for years without them ever having actually met them in person. And so the idea of a meet and greet was that I'm going to give you this in-person experience with me for the first time in your life. And these girls will travel far and wide to do that. And it's basically just taking that interaction off the computer and putting it into real life.", "Well, I think that for people who aren't familiar with what's going on with teenagers, you know, it might be confusing because I think people might understand the concept of, like, meeting the boys in your - the band that you like. But these guys, these young guys, these boy broadcasts - they're just guys, right? They're not selling, like, we're in a band. We're not singers.", "No.", "They're not performers. They're basically what - like online friends?", "Yeah. They're selling live my life with me. And so it's like you can wake up with me. You can eat breakfast with me. You can know my mom. You can know my dog. And these girls just, like, tune into that alone. And it's very strange, but once I started filming and talking to a lot of these girls, I realized it's a response to what's going on in their life. And all they want so desperately is for someone to care about them and someone that's a peer - like, you know, not necessarily their parents, but, like, they want to feel like they're walking down the halls of high school, and someone notices them.", "So let me just play a short clip from the film where you - where some of the girls talk about their connection to these boys who are the center of these boy broadcasts. And here it is.", "UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The fact they're popular and they act like that, it's really incredible how they're so nice to us.", "UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Like, I feel like he's a friend, but he doesn't know yet that we're - we have connection, I guess.", "UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I just feel like they're, like, family to me sometimes because, like, they always say, like, I'm there for you, and don't cut yourself. So then I stopped doing that because they told me to.", "So the level of influence that they have is - seems, you know, fairly significant, right?", "Yeah. I mean, they are aware that these are girls that feel insecure and unloved and lonely, and they're leaning into that, and they're saying, I can help you with that. I can make you feel better about yourself.", "So the focus of the film, as I said, is it started - as I understand it, it started out you were interested in these girls - like, why did they watch these broadcasts? But then you got really interested in this young kid, Austyn Tester, who's trying to make it. And he doesn't sing. He doesn't dance. He's just a nice young guy.", "I'm not famous right now. Hopefully, I'll be famous soon. And I'm just going to tell you this, guys - just whatever you want in life, go get it.", "What is his deal? Like, what's he trying to do?", "Yeah. I think - I mean, at first, I was it was interested in the girls, and I started there. But I I felt like they felt like they knew these boys so well. And I was, like, surely you don't because there's nothing that you receive online that's the whole truth. And they were being almost manipulated to think that they were getting this real version of the boys. And I just feel like when I was watching the broadcasts and stuff and also just when I - just sort of thinking about people's presence on the Internet - that is not them, even if that's what they're selling.", "And so I knew I wanted to find someone who had, like, sort of high stakes in terms of making it. And so I kind of felt like Austyn had a lot of the similar struggles as the girls, and he was also trying to escape something, and he so desperately wanted out and, like, some sort of social upward mobility. And I just felt like he would make for a good main character.", "One of the things that I think this film really shows is this is a grind. I mean, he's expected to post, you know, all the time. It's just not that easy, you know?", "No.", "And...", "It's not.", "And the other side of the film is, like, he's in a small town in Tennessee. And on the other side of the country, you have another character named Michael Weist, who is a manager. And that's a whole scene. He's living with his clients in this house in LA - kind of looks like a bit of a frat house. I'll play the short clip, and then people can kind of come to their own conclusions. But it comes off like he's bullying, goading them, like, into posting all day. Let me just play this clip, and then we can talk more about it.", "Yes. You're going to do the damn video.", "UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: I don't have a camera. My camera got stolen.", "We're going to find a camera. There - looks like there's the camera right there on the counter. You're going to use that.", "UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Can we do something else? Like...", "No.", "UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: I was just on broadcast for 35 minutes.", "OK. I'm sorry you had to work for 45 minutes. Now you're going to film a video.", "OK. You know, all kinds of alarms are going off in my head while I'm watching this. Like, first of all, is this a typical setup? I mean, is this the way it works? Because I understand that a lot of people in order to kind of grow their social media presence do engage managers and people like that. But is this a typical setup?", "I mean, the thing that I found to be really weird when I was first starting this film was when I would look up different boys that were on tour, every single one of them had a manager. And so I immediately was, like, I need to put a manager in this film. And so Michael was actually just a very unique character to me. Like, he himself was a teenager managing these other teenagers, acting like a businessman and conceptualizing everything they were doing, running all their finances, making all the brand deals. And I just was feeling like this was a teenage world run by teenagers for teenagers.", "But again, like, all kinds of alarms are going off in my head here. Like, what is going on in that house?", "So the house that you see in the film is kind of like a concept house. So he invites all these boys to live with him. And they're teenage boys, so they leave their parents' house, and they live in this, like, mansion in Hollywood Hills. And they all have, like, social media presence. Like, they all have, like, a lot of followers. But then he also brings in some boys that don't have that many followers, and he grows the ones that don't have many followers. And the ones that do have a lot of followers - he gets them even bigger. And they're supposed to collab on videos, and they're just supposed to constantly turn out content.", "You know, it seems, though, that this - you know, this film is about, like, a phenomenon that's going on. As you said, it's like an economy. It's like a world run by teens for teens. And part of me thinks what this film is really about is, like, the American dream and how...", "Absolutely.", "That's not really accessible to these kids except through this.", "I love that you said that because the entire time I was filming, I was thinking of, like, this new American dream because we were all over America filming this film through - from casting to go into different shows to filming with different girls and different boys. And I just felt like every single person is a channel now, and every single person wants to use that channel to get famous. And the new American dream is overnight celebrity through social media. And so all these kids are growing up who are super tuned-in to social media feeling like they are really close to that dream. But it's an illusion. It's totally an illusion.", "That's Liza Mandelup.

You know, where is this going to take place?

They were giving us information faster than the school could give us information - a lot like what seems to be going on now at Virginia Tech. So we kind of relied on the media to give us that information, but you're also trying to see through the rumors of the media. And the media surrounded our campus until the end of the school year. The shooting happened in March and they were there until, you know, the beginning of June.", "Back then, in the media aftermath, what helped you to deal with that experience?", "You know, I think it's really important, Renee, that I had very good parents. They were there with me to support me and make sure that I was looked after. I also was very quickly surrounded by good people - you know, counselors and ministers that the school had brought in that said, you know, it's okay to be frightened and scared and confused and that is all part of this process of healing.

His father was right. Don Laub became a doctor. By the 1960s, Don was a young, ambitious plastic surgeon at Stanford University, very much in awe of his prize-winning colleagues. He was looking for a place to make his mark. One day, a colleague walked out of an examination room and came up to him.", "He said, Don, I want you to see a patient. It's a good case that you might not like it. It's a sex change.", "This was 1968 well before the modern transgender rights movement.", "I said send that patient away. I'm a Catholic boy from the Midwest, and I'm at Stanford. We don't do those things.", "Don's colleague insisted he meet the patient, and although Don initially blanched at the idea of gender reassignment surgery, he also felt a shiver of excitement. So he didn't send the patient away. Instead, he consulted with psychiatrists and the few surgeons around the world who performed this kind of work.", "It was a wonderful opportunity to do a big thing and to help a lot of people.", "Altruism and ambition were always tightly woven in Don's identity. He wanted to change the world. In other words, Don Laub was a hedgehog. Here's what I mean by that. Thousands of years ago, the Greek poet Archilochus said the fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.", "That parable has been the subject of much debate over the last 2,500 years. What exactly are Archilochus meant.", "This is University of Pennsylvania psychology professor Phil Tetlock.", "Various people have offered various interpretations. Some people coming out on the side of the hedgehog and other people saying no it really means the fox is going to do better.", "There are different ways to think about the metaphor, but here's how I see it. If a fox wants dinner, it can chase down a hedgehog. It can find something else to eat. It can even go without food for a day. But if you're a hedgehog being chased by a fox, you don't have multiple goals. You have one. Don't get eaten. Phil Tetlock thinks this metaphor describes two cognitive styles of people. Foxes have different strategies for different problems. They're comfortable with nuance. Hedgehogs focus on the big picture.", "The hedgehogs are more the big idea of people who are decisive. In most MBA programs, they'd probably be viewed as better leadership material.", "In November 1968, Don Laub made a very hedgehoggy decision. He performed California's first gender reassignment surgery.", "And we were more than prepared for all of certain things that might happen.", "Don soon became one of the world's leading experts on gender reassignment surgery or what today is called gender confirmation surgery. His reputation grew, a reputation for being a good surgeon and a tough gatekeeper. One of his patients, Sandy Stone, vividly remembers an encounter.", "At some point, he asked me if I were 100 percent committed to wanting surgery. And I said, no, I'm not. I'm probably 99.9 percent. I think anyone who is 100 percent committed to anything is probably crazy. And Don said, well, in that case you're not eligible for surgery.", "It took a mediated session with Don's assistant for the two of them to resolve the conflict. But the incident revealed something about the way a hedgehog moves through the world. Hedgehogs are decisive. Don could not understand anything less than 100 percent commitment. Sandy underwent surgery in 1977. It was a success. When she considers Dan's influence on her life, she says it all comes down to the pursuit of a big idea.", "Do you go for the big one or do you accept something less? And many of us accept something worse because we don't want to take the risk, and then we may go through life maybe we'll be happy with our measure. Or maybe we'll say what if I had gone for what I really wanted? What would that have been like? Maybe I would have died, but I didn't. I beat the odds. And I went on to be gloriously happy. And Don brought that to many people.", "Don's leap into the unknown, his confidence in his own judgment, it had all paid off. But pursuing a big idea with determination doesn't always lead to victory. And when a hedgehog fails, the fall can be painful. Before Don became a world renowned gender reassignment surgeon, he had another big idea. It started this way. One day a colleague asked him if he could help with the surgery. The patient was a child from Mexico.", "This was a 14-year-old boy who had no other deformity than his cleft lip and palate.", "But because of it, the boy was shunned.", "He had not gone to school. He had no educational advancement. He had no friends.", "The surgery to repair the gap in his palate and lip was simple and quick, and it gave this child a real chance in life. Don felt this was the kind of patient he wanted to serve. He turned to the priest who had brought the boy to Stanford all the way from Mexico.", "I asked him are there other patients in Mexico like this? They said the place is full of them. So we bought an airplane ticket and went down to Mexicali and asked for a clinic.", "He soon found himself in a dusty border town whose main medical facility was an old, wooden home.", "It had a dirt floor part of it in. The back part of that clinic was used to raise fighting cocks.", "A rational fox might have calculated the odds and backed down, not Don. He recruited local health officials to get word out that they would be providing free surgeries for children with cleft palates and bone scars. The clinic was quickly packed.", "The first patient I saw was sitting there with a bag on his head with two little peep holes. I said what's with the - why the bag?", "Behind those peepholes was a little boy named Eugenio hiding his face in shame. Don asked if he could take a look.", "So he got the bag off and he had a burn scar that pulled this eyelid down, a simple thing to repair.", "Don repaired the scarred eyelid and still remembers the boy's first reaction.", "He had a very nice, huge smile.", "On a follow up trip, Don tracked Eugenio down.", "He shook hands and everything like that even as a young kid. And he said I have friends in school now.", "Don loved it.", "It's a real happiness. It's a source of happiness is the best description.", "Don's medical missions formally started in 1966. They grew quickly. One day, a woman arrived at the clinic with her young son Salvador. He had bilateral clefs two clefts rather than one. Salvador was a perfect candidate for surgery. That is until a doctor on the team gave the boy a thorough physical and listened to his heart with a stethoscope.", "His mother brought him in and the pediatrician listened and it was whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, the heart sounds.", "These were not normal sounds. The boy's heart had a hole in it. The risk of proceeding with surgery was small, but potentially fatal. They gave the mother the bad news.", "We can't operate because we don't have the equipment in Mexicali to do the heart catheterization or anything like that or even get an EKG today. So...", "I should say here that we're going only on Don's account of what happened. The medical records from that era are incomplete, and we weren't able to find the mother. A few months after sending the child away, Don and his team were back in Mexicali. The mother and her son were waiting. Salvador she told him was shunned. He had no friends. Other children called him the monster.", "The mother said this child has no chance in life. You've got to fix it.", "Don's heart went out to the little boy. He explained the danger again. The risk was small, but it meant things could go seriously wrong. So the answer again was no. More months passed. Don returned to the clinic. So did the mother.", "Por favor, please doctor.", "This was a critical moment. Don could again have said no. Medical protocol said that was the right call. But Don also knew that without surgery Salvador would always be an outcast. Could he have tried to take the boy back to Stanford where heart surgeons could have assisted with his care? Maybe but that would have been a drain on critical resources from the project in Mexico, resources that were helping hundreds of other children. So Don did what Don always did. He took a deep breath that said, OK, we'll do it.", "I feel like that's why I existed is for this judgment. I mean, I'm not there to take care of little pimples. I'm there to do the tough cases.", "The morning of the surgery, Salvador went through the standard pre-surgery lab tests and checkup. And then the boy walked by himself into the operating room.", "And he gets on the operating table himself because he trusts the whole world.", "The surgery began. First, Salvador was anesthetized then Don and his team began the surgery.", "When we were operating, everything was going perfect.", "And then just like that it wasn't.", "Anesthesiologist said, boys, we have no pulse.", "They tried everything - CPR, medicine to jumpstart the heart. Nothing what. The child was dead. Outside the operating room, the boy's mother was waiting anxiously for news of her son. Dawn told her they'd had complications that they tried hard but the boy had died. The mother began to sob. But then Don says she did something surprising. She asked him why he was upset.", "She said you should be happy because the child is seeing God with a complete face.", "Don expected accusation, anger and deep sorrow. Instead, he encountered a mother who leaned heavily on her faith. He was speechless, not just because of what she'd said but because he was struck by another thought. Salvador's face was not repaired. He died before the surgery was complete What would the mother say when she saw her son at the funeral? Don conferred with this team about finishing the surgery on the little boy.", "I said it's against the law, but I think in this case we should.", "The rest of the team unanimously agreed. Salvador was brought back from the morgue.", "The child came back in a body bag, and we did the whole thing as if the child was awake.", "I interviewed Don several times for the story. I pushed hard to understand why he decided to operate on Salvador.", "I thought this is what I am for. This is my purpose.", "Don still thinks about Salvador. He has turned the case over in his head in every possible way. I asked him over and over whether he felt regret.", "No, well, of course, I do. Of course, I do. Yes, I do.", "Here's the thing about foxes and hedgehogs. We tend to want the best of both worlds. We love bold visionaries who take big risks except when the risks don't work out, then we prefer the visionaries to be more cautious, filled with a little self-doubt.

Kyle White To Receive Medal Of Honor", "summary": "Renee Montagne talks to Kyle White, who will receive the Medal of Honor for actions conducted during a 2007 battle in Afghanistan. He was with U.S. and Afghan forces when the Taliban ambushed them.", "utt": ["Let's take you now to a story of heroism on a battlefield in Afghanistan. It was November 2007. Army Specialist Kyle White was with his platoon and a squad of Afghan soldiers and their U.S. Marine trainer in a remote, mountainous part of northeastern Afghanistan. They were ambushed. And in a lengthy firefight with the Taliban, the 20-year-old White risked his life many times trying to save others, and did save the life of fellow soldier Kain Schilling. For those actions, he will be presented with the nation's highest military medal, the Medal of Honor. When Kyle White joined us, he described how that day began, when his group of soldiers went into a local village to meet with the elders.", "Normally, when we go to these meetings, there's, you know, a few, you know, the elders there, and they won't be too enthusiastic. But on this day, it seemed that every male fighting agent above was in attendance. And they were just gathered in a horseshoe-shaped formation around us, and just very close packed in together and very attentive to every single thing we had to say.", "Sounds like a good thing, but that unusual level of interest suggested danger. Their interpreter was also troubled by some chatter he heard on the radio. So, the group decided to leave immediately, and as they made their way back up the mountain, gunfire rang out.", "It started as a single gunshot, then two, and then it seemed the whole valley erupted. And it just was - the amount of fire, it seemed to come from every direction. And, you know, I fired my first magazine, and I loaded another one. That's when a rocket-propelled grenade hit right behind my head and knocked me unconscious.", "When you came to, what did you find?", "When I came to, I was face down in just a large piece of, like, shale rock. And as I picked my head up, an enemy round hit that rock and fragmented into my face. And that kind of brought me back to reality pretty quickly. And I remember putting my hand to my face and pulling it back, and my hand was covered in blood. And as I looked at Specialist Schilling, I could see him running behind a canopy of just one lone tree that was on the trail. As he was running, I noticed that he'd been shot in his right shoulder and was dragging his arm. I got up to go move to his position and put a tourniquet on his right arm.", "And then Marine Sergeant Philip Bocks was further down. And what - on the ground, hit?", "Yes. So, once I saw that he had been wounded, I yelled at him to, you know, use all your strength and try to get to me. You know, just use whatever you can. And he's trying to move, but he's kind of just - he's not making any progress at this point. And the fire that's coming in, it's just kind of like a hailstorm. I saw that he'd been wounded and he had helped, and I know that if the roles were reversed, he would have came out and done the same for me. And so I made the decision to just get up and go to him and try to drag him to where I was.", "And as I was running out towards Sergeant Bocks, every enemy fighter than was able to see me was firing at me, because the amount of bullets that were coming in, they were so close, you can feel the pressure from the round going by your face. They're snapping through my uniform. You see little puffs of fabric. And I just know that I got to get to him and I got to get back to my position. And so when I grabbed him and started dragging him, I realized that, you know, they weren't shooting at him before I ran out here. They're not really focused on him. They're focusing on me. And I knew the longer I sat there and dragged him, the greater chance he had of being wounded again.", "And so I made the decision to kind of draw their fire away from Bocks by running back to Kain's position - Kain Schilling, that's Specialist Schilling. And running back to his position long enough to distract them and have them follow me, and then wait a second and then repeat the movement. I did that about three or four times until I got Sergeant Bocks back to our location.", "He was badly wounded, right?", "Yes, he was. And so when I got him to relatively concealed location, I put a tourniquet on his leg and then dressed the wound that was on his left shoulder. But I found that there had been an exit wound in his ribcage. It was bleeding pretty profusely. So, I tried to stop the bleeding as best I could, but he died not long after.", "So, you knew Sergeant Bocks hadn't made it, but you still, you looked over and you spotted the platoon leader, First Lieutenant Matthew Ferrara, and he was in bad shape, too, as far as you could see, right?", "I saw his helmet and his assault pack he carried on his back. And it's just that the way the terrain was shaped, that's all I could see from where I was at. And I didn't know if he was alive or dead, but I knew I had to go out and check on him. And so I kind of just crawled out there to go check on him. You know, when I got to him, I checked his pulse, and he had already died.", "How much longer did this firefight go on?", "Well, the firefight lasted about four hours. It started 3:30 in the afternoon, and it pretty much ended when night had fallen. It seemed like we were on that hillside forever. I don't know the actual amount of time that had passed from, you know, when the ambush started till when we were actually medically evacuated out of there.", "You have described this so vividly. I'm just wondering - this is seven years later - how much it imposes itself on you, the thoughts and the memories?", "It's something you still think about every day. You know, I still have these images from that day burned into my head. But it's something, as time goes on, it gets easier.", "You've said that something - I'm quoting you now, I've read - you said that \"something changed\" in you that day. What changed?", "Even to this day, you know, I can't say if it was something good or bad. Just something changed after that day. And that was pretty much the reason why I decided to leave the Army, as well. When it came time to reenlist, I figured, you know, if I don't have, you know, my 100 percent, you know, heart and mind in what I'm doing here, when I go down back to Afghanistan and I have soldiers that are going to look to me to be a leader, you know, they deserve to have the best leaders they can have. And I didn't feel, at that time, I could give that to them.", "Well, you had already given your best, which was extraordinary.", "I just was literally doing the job I was trained to do.

A lot of governments in the region thought that at some point after 2011, things started to go back to normal. But obviously, many of the reasons why we had the 2011 uprisings in the first place have not been solved. And obviously, everyone in the region, whether they are peoples or governments - they're watching to see where the region goes to from here in light of what's happening in Sudan and Algeria.", "And what do you think message the demonstrators are drawing from the events of 2011 - and also, what message you think the governing bodies are drawing from the events of 2011? Because, for example, in Sudan, the defense minister has said that a military council will rule for the next two years before any democratic elections are held. You know, it's hard to see that the protesters will find that acceptable. So I'm just wondering what you see. Like, what are both sides drawing from the sort of recent past about what the path forward should be?", "The protesters in Sudan - they say they've learned a lot from what happened way back in 2011. They've learned not to trust the military. They've learned to say that the military's role is basically to secure the border and to maintain stability - not to run the people's affairs. To what extent will the military in Sudan and the militaries throughout the region actually watching what's happening in Sudan will be convinced by that remains to be seen.", "Could you talk a little bit more about what the roots of this are? Because I think many people with even a cursory understanding of the region will know that these leaders have been in power for many, many years, that economic stagnation has been the rule, not the exception. So what are the sparks? Like, what is it that finally caused people to say, enough?", "Well, I mean, in the case of Sudan, the Sudanese, they've had two revolutions. They had one in the '60s, and they had one in the '80s. And in each one of those, obviously, the developments yielded a civilian government, but then the military took over. The protesters - they tried to avoid that same fate for a third time. Life is hard in Sudan, as it is in many other parts of the Middle East and Africa. Prices are high. Bread is not always easy to come by. Salaries are very low. There's a lot of unemployment. There's a youth bulge. Not many jobs are available. And add to that the issue of freedoms. A lot of people are in jail. A lot of people have been in jail in Sudan and other parts of the region.", "This spark, obviously, this time round was bread, higher - high bread prices. You know, the government was squeezed for funds - although its critics are saying there's a lot of corruption, that there's a lot of money that's been embezzled and stolen. But here we are. Now Bashir is gone. A military council has taken its place, and the Sudanese are trying to fumble the next step into their future.", "And what about in Algeria? What about with Bouteflika? I mean, he's been suffering health problems. He hasn't been visible. What is the spark there?", "There are similar reasons in terms of the hardships of daily life. And in the case of Algeria, the spark was that the former president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who to all intents and purposes - I mean, when you see him in - on TV, he's in a wheelchair. He doesn't always seem to be conscious. And yet, it was announced that he was going to run for a fifth term. Algerians took to the street to say no. We cannot have that. He must be just a puppet. There are other players behind him trying to manipulate the situation for their own advantage. That's how it started.", "In each of these cases, in Sudan and in Algeria, is there a sort of an opposition figure like we've seen in Venezuela, for example, where Juan Guaido has sort of - has become recognized as the face of the opposition - like, the preferred leader? Is that the case in either of these places?", "That has been a unique characteristic of all these revolutions throughout North Africa and the Middle East since 2011. They have not actually produced a particular figurehead, so to speak, to lead them. And maybe that was done by design because the people who have risen against their governments - they don't always trust the conventional opposition, and they often feel that it's in cahoots with the regime that they're trying to topple.", "But we have seen the downside of that in terms of these protesters needing somebody to rally around and, you know, make their word heard much more forcefully than it would have been otherwise. In the specific case of Sudan, that's also - definitely that has been the case of a lot of protests, a lot of protesters, but so far, we haven't seen one person who can take all these events and galvanize them to actually help push for change. And the opinion is different whether that's a good thing or or a bad thing. It depends who from the protesters you talk to.", "And so, finally, what is the U.S. role in all this? Or how has the U.S. responded? I mean, in recent years, you know, obviously, Sudan has been an international pariah because of its treatment of the - because of its conduct in Darfur, the military's conduct in Darfur. But the U.S. has been cooperating with Sudan on intelligence in recent years. So what's the U.S. role now? Or how is the U.S. responding?", "Well, the stakes for the U.S. in all these places are very high. They are higher in Sudan than they are in Algeria, for example. Algeria is much more tied to France and so on. In the case of Sudan, there's the issue of Darfur. There's the issue of relations between North Sudan and the young South Sudan. And, you know, the U.S. was very supportive of the independence of South Sudan.", "But there's also the issue of terrorism, and the U.S. is very invested in that. Sudan was under sanctions, but the U.S. did get to a point where it was working with Bashir very closely in combating terrorism. So it's obviously a very complex situation. Sudan is a central country to different regional groupings and central to a lot of issues that are of interest to various players, including the United States.", "That's Abderrahim Foukara.

So in an urban area, these large birds seem to be adapting their feeding habits, much like the little cattle egrets, which are a pasture bird, have done the same thing.", "Huh, what do you think of that?", "Well, that is a first for me because I was thinking, as he was telling the story, that it probably was a cattle egret, because we've seen them do that. They're called cattle egrets, of course, because they follow behind cows and kick up whatever insects or lizards or whatever follow the cows.", "And so as the listener said, they came into the urban areas first and started taking advantage of whatever food we had in that area.

They've both had improbable rides to tonight's title game.", "For more, I'm joined by NPR's Tom Goldman who will be covering the game in Arlington, Texas. And, Tom, let's talk first about this match up, give us a few things to look out for.", "Sure, Melissa. Let's start with guard play. OK?", "OK.", "And the UConn guards, Shabazz Napier and Ryan Boatwright, against Kentucky's Harrison twins, Andrew and Aaron. Now, the UConn guys each are about six inches shorter than the 6'6\" Harrisons, and can Napier and Boatwright utilize their quickness to get steals and generally harass. Now, nearer to the basket Kentucky is a big dominating team that usually out of rebounds opponents, with 7 foot center Dakari Johnson, 6'9\" 250 pound Julius Randle.", "UConn's forward Deandre Daniels is a wisp by comparison, 6'9\" 195, but he's quick and agile, a good shooter. He scored 18 points or more eight times this season. UConn won all those games. So if he has a good game offensively, good things can happen.", "Now one other thing, UConn head coach Kevin Ollie says he wants his team to make Kentucky shoot from the outside. Of course, what he doesn't want is a close game at the end and Kentucky guard Aaron Harrison shooting from the outside. Harrison is, of course, on this never before seen streak, three straight games where he's clinched the victory with a last second three point shot.", "And, Tom, there's been a lot of talk about the fact that this is an unlikely match up, a seventh seed UConn going up against an eighth seed in Kentucky. What does that really mean though?", "Yeah, it mainly means that your top seeds, the ones and twos, the supposed best teams are long gone. Seven and eight are pretty low. Although most people think the teams, especially Kentucky, were under-seeded. Still, it is a match up few if any predicted.", "I will give you a personal example. I just happened to win my March Madness pool. And it had about 70 entrants and I didn't pick the two teams playing in the championship. And I don't think that's ever happened, in our pool at least. You get most points for picking the finalists and the champion, but I won without doing it. I have to say I'm ashamed...", "...about that but someone has to win.", "And a match up that might not have been predicted if you looked at how poorly both of these schools were doing at various times of the season.", "Absolutely. Kentucky started with visions of a perfect season. They were a team loaded with top high school talent but they struggled, as freshmen do. Coach John Calipari struggled. By own admission, he made bad coaching moves trying to figure out this team. Less than a month ago, the Wildcats had even fallen out of the Associated Press poll of the top 25 teams.", "UConn also fell completely out of the poll. Earlier in season, the Huskies were up and down, lost to Louisville three times, including an 81-48 shellacking at the end the regular season.", "And if you look back at last season, Tom, neither of these teams even made it to the NCAA Tournament.", "Yeah. In fact, tonight is the first time since 1966 that the finalists weren't in the previous tournament. Kentucky wasn't very good. Kentucky lost in the National Invitational Tournament, the NIT. UConn was banned from March Madness because the basketball team had a low academic rating. The Huskies now are meeting the standard, although reportedly they still have a pretty low rating. They're digging their way out.", "Tom, we should mention, too, that the Connecticut women's team will be playing in the NCAA title game tomorrow night. What about a quick appraisal of that game?", "UConn versus Notre Dame, the combined records this season are 76 wins and no losses. Notre Dame is missing a key player in forward Natalie Achonwa. The rest of the team is going to have to pick up the slack. It's going to be a tall order to do against a fantastic UConn team.", "OK.

Shaun's been following all of this. Good morning.", "Good morning.", "What more do we know at this point about this suspect authorities have named?", "Well, you know, we've had really conflicting information overnight. And, you know, we do now seem to be honing in on this 22 year old who was born in the south of Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet Republic from which, you know, hundreds of thousands of workers come and work in Russia. And as far as we know, he had a Russian passport. He'd been living in Russia for several years. But so far, we've only got confirmation of this from Kyrgyz intelligence. The Russians haven't actually confirmed that this is definitely the person behind it. So, you know, a lot of the details still sketchy.", "We don't even know - you know, we think that he was a suicide bomber, but we haven't had official confirmation that he did actually die in the blast or, you know, possible still that he could have left the bomb on the train and detonated it remotely. So some of the information is falling into place, but a lot of details are still quite sketchy.", "Yeah, questions still. So there have been attacks like this since the breakup of the Soviet Union against Russia. How does this attack fit in with that pattern?", "Well, I think, you know, obviously at this stage it's all a lot of speculation. But I think whereas, you know, earlier if you remember those kind of attacks and the school siege in Beslan or the theater siege in Moscow back in 2002, you know, a bunch of terrorist acts that hit Moscow over the years. And they were often tied to the Chechen independence cause which gradually took on more and more of a kind of Islamist bend to it. But in recent years, I think the Chechen cause has kind of morphed into, you know, we've seen a lot of the Chechen commanders go and find Syria, pledge allegiance to the Islamic State.", "And then we've also seen people from those poor republics of Central Asia like Kyrgyzstan, also hundreds of them ending up fighting in Syria and pledging allegiance to the Islamic State as well. And we've also had reports of people perhaps not dissimilar to the suspect here of the young Uzbek or Kyrgyz men who come and work in terrible conditions in Russia and end up actually getting radicalized inside Russia. So, you know, again, bit too early to tell. But that might sort of turn out to be something that - a similar case here.", "So how does that feed President Vladimir Putin's message about how he is fighting the so-called war on terror, the war against ISIS? I mean, do attacks like these strengthen or weaken Vladimir Putin?", "Well I think, you know, it probably depends a little bit on your view of him to start with. So, you know, the people who are skeptical of Putin's actions, for example, in Syria, you know, the Russians wading into that conflict in 2015 would say, well, look, you know, you said you were going into Syria to make Russia more safe. And this is the response, you're targeted by the Islamic State. And that's kind of blowback to Syria actions.", "On the other hand, Russians who are sort of supportive of what Putin's doing in Syria would say, well, you know, look, everybody is fighting terrorism. This is no different to what's happening in other Western capitals. And, you know, this is proof that what we're doing in Syria is right. And we have to fight this. So I think, you know, opinions will differ on that one.", "Yeah. Shaun Walker is Moscow correspondent for The Guardian newspaper.

We believe government should employ all the tools that are available to it to support an industry that's in distress and is important to the economy.", "One tool GM is looking at is the Treasury Department's $700 billion bailout fund. The money was originally designed to buy toxic mortgage-backed securities. Now it's being used to pump money into banks. Treasury spokeswoman Brooklyn McLaughlin described the kind of firms that qualify.", "The Capital Purchase Program is available to federally regulated banks and savings institutions.", "OK, that does not sound like General Motors. But GM does have a loan financing arm, GMAC. And Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has proved creative as the credit crisis has spread to a variety of industries. Another place GM is looking for money is the Department of Energy. The agency has $25 billion set aside for the auto industry. But that money is designed to promote fuel-efficient vehicles, not mergers. Haley Baumgardner, a spokeswoman for the agency, would not confirm any conversations with GM, but she added this from a statement.", "The Department of Energy has always had an open line of communication with the automakers, an industry we highly support as part of our Advanced Vehicle Technology program, among others.", "Baumgardner said the agency is still writing the rules for the loan program.

Bragman says GM needs cash just to survive.", "Sales are down such to the point where they're just basically not making any money, and they're really losing their shirt in the market. So they have to try and find new sources, more people that'll lend them money.", "That's one reason GM is eying Chrysler. The smallest of the Detroit three has lots of problems, but as of a few months ago it also had $11 billion on hand. The other reason GM wants Chrysler is some valuable brands, including Jeep and the Dodge minivan. But Aaron Bragman acknowledges that combining the firms won't be easy.", "It's basically taking two sick companies and putting them together and trying to make one healthy company out of it. And that's not going to happen without a lot of cutting and a lot of slashing and a lot of burning.", "GM would have to get rid of many competing Chrysler brands. It would also have to lay off many thousands of workers.

I think what we are seeing with Erdogan right now is particularly directed against Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS.", "And this is the crown prince right now.", "Absolutely, absolutely, who King Salman designated as the heir in 2017. Erdogan, I think, never has really trusted him. I think he thought that the West was buying into his reformist image while he was engaging in crackdowns. He's 33, which means he's likely to be in power for a number of decades. And I think Erdogan always saw him as being particularly unfavorable to Turkish regional interests. And so I think what we are likely to see from Erdogan in his speech tomorrow is continued efforts to try and impose maximum damage on MBS.", "Meaning he wants him replaced, a new heir called.", "Ideally I think he would like MBS removed or at least weakened in terms of removing his de facto powers on the foreign policy side.", "So is this speech directed really at President Trump, the U.S.? Is that the nation that could bring this pressure to bear?", "Erdogan certainly recognizes that Turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own, and so it really is going to be, as you say, the United States that is going to have to do this. Erdogan has been quite quiet over the last week and a half. And a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources. And I think it's not in Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis.", "But I think this weekend, when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened and, as you noted, some questions about their claims about what happened, the effort has shifted from showing that it was a premeditated murder by a professional team who came to Istanbul to providing possibly in Erdogan's remarks tomorrow more evidence of a direct link of these operations to MBS himself, which then would put further pressure on Trump in terms of his response.", "As we said, you just got back from Turkey. What are you hearing in terms of what we're expecting tomorrow?", "It's unclear how much detail there's actually going to be in Erdogan's remarks. I think we'll continue to see some of these more specific details coming out from government officials. I think Turkish prosecutors are likely to come forward with their case in the next couple of days. What was particularly interesting in Turkey was there was an initial assumption early last week that perhaps what Erdogan was looking for was a financial bailout from the Saudis given the financial crisis that we've had in Turkey. But that attitude really started to shift in the latter part of the week with an increasing sense that this was being targeted at weakening MBS himself.", "That's Amanda Sloat.

Why was this important to you?", "It's important to me because this university's modern existence is possible because of that 1838 sale. It's important to me because as an American citizen, I know that this country was founded upon the labor of enslaved African-American people. So to me, this is really my way of using the resources that I have to empower others - resources that I have because of the ancestors of descendants.", "Let me ask you a question I gather some of your fellow students have asked. Why should today's students, including African-American students, whose families already have to pay tens of thousands of dollars in tuition, have to pay to support a fund to try to compensate for sins that were committed 180 years ago?", "I think that what's been helpful is recognizing that while the university committed moral sins and should go through the process of morally rectifying that history, that slaveholding legacy, Georgetown students, as beneficiaries and members of the Georgetown University community, also have a similar obligation.", "This week's vote, as I don't have to tell you, was nonbinding. The board of trustees would have to implement it. I wonder if you've spoken with anyone on that board, have any idea how they're inclined.", "I think that there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen next.

What would you say to them?", "I would encourage them to develop a personal connection with Georgetown University's slaveholding legacy. This isn't about punishment. This is not a punitive measure. This is about using resources, giving back resources.

There are about 40 ships and more than two dozen aircraft from around nine nations in the area, all looking for traces of the plane. They started at the last-known location of the plane, and they're searching in an area around 50 square nautical miles from that. Over the weekend, there were several reports of debris sighted in the area. The Vietnamese, for example, said they saw something from a military plane that looks like it could have been the airplane door of the missing flight. Malaysian civil aviation authorities have come out and said no. So, none of these sightings have proved conclusive. None of these sightings of debris or anything can be positively linked to the missing plane.", "Well, let's talk about what seems like unusual activity among some of the passengers.

What is that all about, and what's the latest?", "On the flight's manifest were listed an Italian and an Austrian passenger. Neither of those two people boarded the plane. They were later found elsewhere. But people using their passports, which were both stolen in Thailand, did get aboard the plane, and Malaysian authorities are using surveillance camera video footage to try to determine who they are. Those two passports were on a database belonging to Interpol. Interpol said Malaysia Airlines never checked with them about these stolen passports. Now, they're going over all of the passports used to board that plane, to see if there were any more that were stolen. Also, we learned this morning from the Malaysian civil aviation authorities that five people checked into that flight who did not board. Now, those people's luggage was taken off the plane, and nothing was found to be amiss. None of the luggage from those people stayed on the plane. But there have been some irregularities, and these are things they have to check into to make sure there was no foul play.", "Well, does this suggest that Malaysia has unusually lax security at its airport?", "Well, they have come in for some criticism, particularly from passengers' families, the media and Interpol, who says that actually a lot of airports are not checking passengers' passports against their stolen documents list. Now, here in Beijing, Malaysia Airlines officials have come for some pretty tough questioning from Chinese media, who I think are reflecting the concerns of the passengers' families who are here in Beijing.", "And what about the passengers' families? How are they holding up under this unique ordeal of not knowing at all what's happening?", "Obviously, it's been very difficult for them, Renee, as you can imagine. At some point, passions have boiled over. Today, people saw water bottles being hurled at Malaysia Airlines officials. Others have gone to the Chinese government to demand a meeting and ask for explanations. And they're divided as to where to go from here. Some of them want to go down to Malaysia. Malaysia Airlines has offered to take them there. Others feel they're just not getting any information at any rate, so there's just no point in going.

I think most economists were expecting, you know, job creation to go down, perhaps not this much. But they thought this was going to happen. It is remarkable in the sense that this is the first time in 83 months, really since 2010, that the economy lost jobs during the month.", "Wow, significant step back. But with these hurricanes, you do have more activity when places start to rebuild. Will there be a bounce back?", "Yes, I think you'll see a rebound pretty quickly in the months to come. You know, there's rebuilding. As you point out, construction jobs get created. And this is still, you know, a pretty healthy economy. Before these numbers came out, we saw on average 176,000 jobs created every month this year. And that's not, you know, spectacular growth, but it is, you know, fairly steady, strong growth. You're hearing a lot of information, a lot of anecdotal information from businesses about how much trouble they're finding workers.

Is that improving people's paychecks, the tight labor market?", "Well, this - we did see an increase in wages in September. Hourly wages have now - are going up at a rate of almost 3 percent this year, so you're seeing a rise in wages. And that's important because the Federal Reserve is going to look at that when it meets in December and decides what to do about interest rates. I mean, always, they have this concern about inflation. You know, when do they start to rein in - increase interest rates and try to rein in the economy?

But if he crashes in Florida, I mean, is it different than losing Iowa or New Hampshire?", "He can say he's going to go on from here, but he does have to prove that South Carolina was not a fluke for him. And he does not have a lot of money. He does not have a lot of organization. That's been evident here in Florida. And from here, we start to move into caucuses. And we move towards Super Tuesday, where you have multiple contests scattered around the country in multiple states. And you just can't do that by turning in a winning debate performance or by holding town halls. You really have to have the money and organization to speak to people. So once we get out of Florida, it gets a lot harder to do the kind of thing he did in South Carolina.", "And, of course, the winner of Florida gets a lot of delegates, all of the delegates in Florida.", "This is a winner-take-all state, though there is some dispute over how the delegates will be apportioned with the national party. Florida has been kind of butting heads with the national party, both in terms of the delegates and in terms of when they would go on the calendar.

A bombshell story in Rolling Stone magazine last month put the University of Virginia under scrutiny for its handling of campus sexual assault cases. The emotional core of that story was a gang rape, a claim that a woman identified only as Jackie was assaulted by seven men at a fraternity party. Then last week, another bombshell - Rolling Stone backed away from its reporting. The managing editor wrote a statement saying the magazine has concerns about the piece and that there, quote, \"now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account.\"", "Last month, NPR spoke with Emily Renda. She handles sexual misconduct response and prevention at the University of Virginia. She's also a graduate of the school and herself a victim of sexual assault. We've called her again to get her take on this latest development.", "Emily, first we should say you know the victim, the woman identified as Jackie. She told you this story when you were with a campus support group. Now, Rolling Stone has said that their trust in her was misplaced. And I'm quoting there. Do you doubt her story?", "No, I don't. I think that there are some larger complexities at play here. There's a lot of good research, you know, citing Dr. David Lisak and Dr. Rebecca Campbell that suggest that traumatic memories are stored differently in the brain. And so as a result, they're brought out by the brain different as well. So through none of this process have I ever disbelieved Jackie. Have I believed that details may change shape over time because of the nature of trauma? Absolutely.", "Have you spoken to her - Jackie - since the news broke?", "I have. You know, I never feel entirely comfortable speaking on somebody else's behalf. But I'll say that this is very overwhelming. And I know that even just personally as a survivor, I knew that when people questioned me, that was pretty traumatic. And so I can't imagine what it's like to have the national news media outlet that you trusted for months, who attempted to convince you to stay in the story on multiple occasions, all of a sudden turn its back on you and kind of take the entire country down a road of doubting you. That's got to be incredibly traumatic.", "Did it strike you that the piece did not include any response from the alleged perpetrators?", "I, you know, stood by Jackie's decisions about not wanting to name her perpetrator or any of her perpetrators. And, you know, frankly that's very common for victims of trauma to be very, very reluctant to do so. But now in retrospect, I really wish that Rolling Stone had done their due diligence because now, on the backend, Jackie is suffering. The men at the fraternity are suffering and, frankly, the credibility of survivors everywhere is suffering.", "So what happens now? I mean, has this story made it harder for victims?", "I think inevitably, in some ways, it definitely will. It will confirm the age-old rape myth that women lie about being raped. And it, you know, inevitably will also make it harder for male survivors to come forward as well. But I am heartened by the response I see coming from students on campus that say, you know, hold up the second. We do know something about trauma and the way that survivors' stories are told. And that this is not her fault for the way that something was reported as truth and fact against her wishes in some ways.", "We can't let this get in the way of good progress. We need to continue to keep the roles of advocate, investigator and adjudicator very separate. Rolling Stone really blurred the line between those three things. And that's what's done so much damage to Jackie, to the fraternity and really ultimately, and very importantly, survivors everywhere.", "Emily Renda handles sexual misconduct response and prevention at the University of Virginia.

There were blessings, pain and new discoveries.", "After Katrina's wrath, the blessings were numerous. The first came in the form of Brown University who helped me continue my studies. Once they found out that I could not attend my school, they made it possible for me to take classes in Providence. The best blessing I received was from a local writer, Jill Davidson, who opened her home and her heart to me. It was here where I discovered how I wanted the world to perceive my life. Seeing Jill made me realize that I not only wanted to be a wife and a mother, but also a successful working woman.", "But, I also faced a lot of pain during my time in Providence. As a senior from a historically black, Catholic institution, I stuck out like a sore thumb. I will never forget being treated like a charity case when a Brown parent gave me money after realizing I was displaced by the hurricane. Yes, I needed the money, but I didn't need anyone's pity.", "The most humbling moment was when I entered a Salvation Army store. I literally broke down into tears. I always donated clothes to the Salvation Army, but receiving articles of clothing was a different story. I remember pinching myself over and over again to make sure I wasn't dreaming, but this was reality. I found myself crying every night and feeling a sense of hopelessness.", "But Jill and her family were a bright spot during all of this.

That was one useful test.", "But how much should we depend on these kinds of tests, because you got several different results from the heart attack test, ranging from probabilities of 30 to 60 percent.", "No, that's right. It was essentially a low, medium and high risk, at least for the genetic parts of the test. And I have to say that that was only part of this test for heart attack, and that part was a little confusing, but when that was added into a lot of other tests, like say, a chest CT scan and some other chemistry, cholesterol, things like that, that's where I began to believe this test, and it got a little more focused into, you know, the high-risk category.", "Let's talk about the brain-age test. You felt pretty competitive going into that.

Both blocs are vying for a majority of seats in parliament.", "NPR's Deborah Amos has been following the vote today and joins us now from Beirut.", "Deb, what's at the heart of today's voting?", "Jacki, the key to this election is the Christian community where the turnout has been as high as 60 to 70 percent. Now the Christians are deeply divided with political parties in the two rival camps. But despite that rivalry, the atmosphere at the voting centers today was more like a holiday. There were honking horns and flags, people hanging around.", "I met families that were divided in their politics. You had young people who were voting for General Michel Aoun's party, the Christian general allied with Hezbollah; and their parents were convinced that the current ruling coalition is the one that's going to deliver.", "How does the Christian vote affect the outcome?", "This is all about numbers in parliament. There are 128 seats; and in Lebanon sectarian politics, the seats are allocated equally: 64 for Christian candidates, 64 for Muslims. Hezbollah has only fielded 11 Shiite candidates. They're expected to win. Another Shiite party Amal, they will win their allocated seats. So you can see that it takes a Christian ally. Remember there are 64 seats for the Christian candidates.", "Deb, just quickly, why would the Christian vote, which I would have thought to be secular in its aspect, ally with Hezbollah?", "Not necessarily secular but certainly not Muslim. The arguments have been that the Christians, a minority, want to ally themselves with a power in the country. Some people argue that another minority, the Shiites in this country, are a better bet. There's also concern that Shi'a fundamentalism is less threatening to Christians than Sunni fundamentalism.

Bishops sent pedophile priests to therapists, not to the police, and many were then reassigned to different parishes, where, too often, they abused more children.", "Last week, NPR religion correspondent Barbara Bradley Hagerty broadcast a story with extraordinary details on the mechanism of the alleged cover-up in one archdiocese, complete with reams of emails from the cardinal on down and a remarkable recording from a deposition.", "In a moment, Barbara joins us to go through the story of Father Michael Baker, Cardinal Roger Mahony and the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, and after that, how the extent and the handling of this scandal in the Catholic Church compares with other religious institutions.", "Later in the program, law professor Kris Kobach argues the case for Arizona's anti-immigration law. But first, NPR's Barbara Bradley Hagerty joins us here in Studio 3A. She's also the author of \"Fingerprints of God: The Search for the Science of Spirituality.\" And thanks very much for coming in.", "It's great to be here, Neal.", "And how did you come upon the story of Father Baker?", "Well, I had been watching Cardinal Roger Mahony since about 2003. I knew that there was a local grand jury that was investigating him way back then. And so when this most recent abuse scandal occurred, I began calling around to plaintiffs' lawyers. And I reached a plaintiffs' lawyer named John Manley, who had just settled a case on behalf of Luis C., a victim, for $2.2 million.", "And what Manley told me is that he had these amazing depositions with a few people. One was Cardinal Mahony. That one was sealed. Another was Richard Byrne, who was a judge who had been the head of the review board. That was sealed.", "But he also told me about this deposition by Richard Loomis, who was the vicar of the clergy in the late 1990s. That was unsealed.", "Now, Loomis is the - kind of the guy who oversees all the priests, and he would know about all the abuse. And when I heard that deposition, I just said, wow. This gives you an inside look at the workings of how the archdiocese handled the allegations against not only Michael Baker, who eventually 23 people said abused him, but also all the cases involving abuse.", "Twenty-three people said he abused them.", "That's right.", "In any case, well, set up this piece of tape. We have this deposition, and this man Loomis is being deposed, and that's where lawyers from both sides are in the room, one from the archdiocese and one representing the victim.", "That's right. And John Manley is representing the victim. Well, early on, this deposition starts to go bad - badly for the archdiocese because Monsignor Loomis said that he thought that they should have called the police, the archdiocese should have called the police early on. They should have let the parishes know about Michael Baker, because that's the way you get other victims to come forward.", "And he said that - you know, he really, at one point, thought about resigning because he was so upset that the cardinal refused to call the police or let any of the parishes know about Michael Baker.", "And this is where the tape picks up.", "That's right.", "Let's listen.", "Did you consider resigning?", "Well, I was almost at the end of my term at that point, anyway. So I probably would have if I was earlier in my term.", "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? You're trying to shut him up. No. You're trying to make him - you're grabbing him, and you're trying to make him be quiet. What are you doing? What are you doing? What in the world are you doing?", "I'm instructing my client.", "You don't whisper in a client's ear in a deposition room, Mr. Woods.", "It happens all the time.", "If you want to take - well, maybe where you practice, but if you want to take a break and talk to your client outside, that's fine. I'm in a line of questioning. You just stood up, put your arm around the witness - which he clearly, on the video, didn't want you to do - and you - and you're trying to get him to be quiet because you don't like his answers.", "Again, that's lawyer John Manley, representing, at that point, an alleged victim, addressing Donald Woods, the attorney you heard trying to intervene with former Vicar Richard Loomis. And...", "It was amazing. You know, what John Manley said is you wait for this kind of thing all your life. You know, as a lawyer, you always hear about Perry Mason or \"A Few Good Men,\" where the witness flips on the stand.", "On the stand, erupts into a sobbing confession.", "And he said, it never happens, right? Right, right, exactly, and it never happens. But in this case, Loomis flipped on Cardinal Mahony. He said it was extraordinary.", "And this is what you call a smoking gun.", "I think it's kind of a smoking gun. I mean, they - very shortly after this, within a couple of months, they settled for $2.2 million.", "And as you said, those other depositions were sealed. Most often, these cases are settled in exchange for confidentiality agreements. Nobody can talk.", "That's absolutely right, and in this case, they went through the hard work of trying to get it unsealed, and they did, and I think it's a pretty damaging deposition for them to have.", "There was, you know, other damaging stuff about this, as well, like the review board.", "Well, there are all these leaked emails, as well.", "Yes, there are leaked emails. Those were just really, really interesting, and let me give you the little bit of the back story on those.", "It's early 2002, and the scandal has just broken in Boston. And so someone in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles leaked emails to a radio station in April of 2002. And I've got to tell you, when you read these emails, you kind of see - they're between Cardinal Mahony and his lawyers, and you have the feeling that Cardinal Mahony and his lawyers care a lot more about giving as little information to the police and the public about the abusive priests, and, you know, they kind of seem to care a lot more about managing the public relations than about the victim.", "And let me just tell you one. I've got one here. This one is from Father - Cardinal Mahony to his lawyers on March 27th, 2002, and it's about what Cardinal Mahony says, quote, \"what I consider to be our biggest tactical mistake of the past few weeks.\"", "He notes that the archdiocese has not turned over three - the names of three of the eight most abusive priests to the district attorney, what they call the Big Eight. And then he says that they better do this. They better start consulting with the district attorney or, quote, \"I can guarantee you that I will get hauled into a grand jury proceeding, and I will be forced to give all the names.\"", "And it - you know, you just have this sense that they were - I mean, what the archdiocese says is they were dealing with a crisis. There was a feeding frenzy by the press, and that they clearly were not - you know, they were just a little bit desperate. But clearly, they didn't want all the information out there.", "And they were worried about their liability rather than, you would think...", "You know, I read all of these emails, and I would be hard-pressed to find one reference to the victims in a compassionate way. Now, there may have been, but there were 68 emails, and it sure was not a theme.", "And there is no question after you look at all this evidence that the cardinal himself knew for a fact that at least this one priest was abusing children.", "Oh, yeah. We know that because Michael Baker told Cardinal Mahony in 1986 that he had abused two kids. So for, you know, since 1986, he knew that he was an abuser. And what happened is he said he took him out of ministry, put him in restricted ministry.", "Supposedly, he wasn't supposed to - that Father Baker wasn't supposed to see children, wasn't supposed to have access to them. However, over the next 15 years, Michael Baker served in nine parishes. Six of them had elementary schools attached to them, and clearly, Father Baker was not being monitored because he abused kids a lot, it appears.", "And, indeed, was involved with this one family where he bought a house for the mother and her two children, whom he was abusing, and they, because he was in this position - not only of trust, but of power - felt they had no choice.", "That's right. That abuse went on for 15 years, and the archdiocese settled very quickly in that case, within a couple of months once they - once they saw Father Michael Baker's love letters to the two boys that spanned over a period of 15 years, they settled for $1.3 million in a couple of months.", "And there is a responsibility, of course - these are their superiors, but this is a religious order. And at the time, back when this first started, you know, 30 years ago, the thought was at the time: send people for treatment. That was not an unusual request at the time.", "That's right. That's right. You handled this pastorally. You send them for treatment, and you hope that they get better and they can be returned to ministry. But, you know, by the 1990s, it was pretty clear that that wasn't working all that well, and we certainly knew that in 2000. And even in 2000, Cardinal Mahony was deciding - when he found out about Michael Baker and these two boys, he was deciding not to go to the police, not to inform the parishes. And some people would say - a lot of people believe that he had legal responsibility to call the police at that point, but at least the archdiocese had a moral responsibility to let people know and the police know that there was a known abuser who was in their midst.", "We're going to go into some details in a few minutes about how extensive this is within the Catholic Church and, indeed, other religious organizations, as well. So clearly, hardly all Catholic priests were abusive. That's not what anybody's saying. Nevertheless, this organization, like any other organization, has responsibilities. These things happened a long time ago, but a district attorney, a prosecutor, might look at this and say ongoing conspiracy.", "Well, that - in fact, I have talked to prosecutors who believe that, and they're very interested in seeing Cardinal Mahony's deposition that's now under seal because they want to see if there is - I mean, I don't want to extrapolate here, but they are very, very interested in what Cardinal Mahony has said in the last few months. Because if you can show that there is some kind of crime being - that's been committed in the last few months, that you can reach back in time under the RICO statute and reach back and touch all these other cases and say, well, you know, maybe it's possible. I know they're investigating whether the archdiocese committed fraud in the way that it covered up the sexual abuse.", "And those investigations are ongoing right now?", "Yes, they are. Right now.", "And the priest again, Father Baker, I assume he's Mr. Baker now?", "Well, he is. He's in jail right now. He's in prison. He's serving a 10-year sentence. He was criminally convicted for abusing three boys. And so he will be - he'll be staying where he is for a little while now.", "Barbara Bradley Hagerty is NPR's religion correspondent. It's - I just - to hear RICO statute and the Catholic Church in the same phrase is just mindboggling that they would be brought up together. This is, of course, a statute passed to address issues with the Mafia and things like that. So...", "That's right.", "So, anyway, when we come back, we're going to be talking about the Catholic Church and the extent of this kind of scandal, how it compares with other institutions and whether other institutions are handling it better than perhaps the Catholic Church is, or did, and whether it is ongoing and how practices have changed.", "So stay with us.

I'm Neal Conan, in Washington.", "Allegations of sexual abuse and cover-up continue to rock the Catholic Church in Europe, South America and, of course, the United States, Australia, as well. Barbara Bradley Hagerty has covered the abuse scandal for years as NPR religion correspondent.", "Her most recent investigation uncovered a series of missteps by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and a failure to act when presented with evidence of pedophilia. We've posted a link to that story at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION.", "While the Catholic Church faces a huge challenge, it is hardly alone in facing allegations of abuse. One study by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice shows about four percent of priests sexually abused children between 1950 and 2002 - more or less in line with other professions.", "Earlier this month, a jury in Oregon reached a $1.4 million verdict against the Boy Scouts. So is the Catholic Church different from other institutions in the scale of sexual abuse or the way those allegations were handled?", "We'd like to hear from non-Catholics in our audience. How has your religious hierarchy dealt with this? Give us a call: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. And you can join the conversation on our Web site. That's at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION.", "And Barbara Bradley Hagerty is still with us here in Studio 3A. And, in general, can you make a summation of - have these allegations emerged in other religious organizations?", "Yes, they have emerged. They tend to be different sorts of allegations. Typically, what you have is - when I've done stories about this is you have, you know, a Baptist minister who has had an affair with a congregant or a youth minister who has had an affair with, you know, a teenage girl in the youth group, or something like that.", "And in those cases - I'll be interested to hear what the listeners have to say - but generally, in those cases, because other denominations are not so hierarchical, what happens is the minister is called into the board of elders and asked about this, and basically said you're gone. You know, they tell him you're gone. They can fire him. It's not quite so easy in the Catholic Church.", "But presumably, that minister can go apply for a job somewhere else.", "He can. But I think he would have a hard - it would be a - have a hard record. Plus, you wouldn't have an overarching body saying okay, this minister is now going to be transferred over here in good standing.", "So it's a little bit different in the Catholic Church. Actually, it's significantly different. For one thing, it's really hard to defrock a priest. I mean, philosophically, bishops - one bishop said recently that defrocking a priest is like a spiritual death, and so they're reluctant to do it.", "But also, you know, it's very cumbersome to get a priest out of his job. Under Pope John Paul II, he essentially ended defrocking of priests, laicizations, for many, many years. And the reason he did that is he felt that priests were there for life, and especially if you were a young priest - like under 40 years old - you shouldn't be laicized.", "Things got a little bit better - things got significantly better under Pope Benedict. But I should say that when a priest is accused of abuse, it's a long process. What happens is the bishop has to do a church trial. That can take years. There's a prosecutor and a defense attorney.", "Then they send all of this off to the Vatican. The Vatican takes a look at all those documents. Sometimes they ask for more documents. They ask for another church trial. It can take, you know, 10, 15 years to defrock a priest.", "And what about - the church just made a statement recently that said, of course, if there's evidence of a crime, that should be presented to the police. That's always been our policy.", "Well, they say that's always been our policy, but it didn't show up in the policy until about, you know, about two weeks ago. And so they may have said that, but you had to very much read between the lines, because it wasn't there before.", "Let's get callers in on the conversation: 800-989-8255. Email, again, is talk@npr.org. Josh is on the line from Mishawaka in Indiana.", "Hi, Neal, thank you very much for allowing me on the air.", "Okay. Go ahead, please.", "I just wanted to relate a story. When I was 11 or 12, I was living in Nova Scotia, Canada, and I was attending Hebrew school there. A Hebrew school teacher by the name of Cantor Freedman(ph) was, I believe, arrested for possession of child pornography. I haven't looked into this as an adult, so I'm not familiar with all the details, but I know he was arrested for possession of child pornography in his apartment. He wasn't married at the time, and then he was deported from Canada, and I believe served a jail term in the United States.", "So he was evidently an American citizen and working in Canada in this capacity. Was the Hebrew school itself involved in the investigation in any way, or - this was a long time ago. You were a kid, and you may not remember the details.", "I don't remember the exact details. So I'm not sure if somebody in the organization turned him over or if he was found by the police through other means. I'm not really sure. I'd have to look into it more. But I just wanted to sort of relate that story.", "Yeah.", "But in sort of response to what your guest commented about, the church trials and all those sort of things, it sort of angers me as a faithful person that they would choose to go through that route, as opposed to what any sane human being should do, which is if, you know, your child has been abused by a priest, go to the police, put them in jail, save the defrocking for later.", "All right.", "Right. And, you know, that's a very interesting point. You know, some documents, there's a document from 1962 that many plaintiffs' attorneys point at, actually, in suing the Vatican, trying to get the Vatican involved in all of this.", "And what these documents seem to suggest is that you don't want - you want to keep all the proceedings very, very quiet, very secret. In fact, these documents say that if someone involved in the trial - whether it's, you know, a bishop or whatever - talks about this case, this case of abuse, that they can be excommunicated.", "And so what these documents seem to suggest, at least to some people, is that the Vatican was sending the signal: You keep these things quiet.", "Now, the Vatican would dispute that. They would say we're only talking about church trials, that if there's actually real abuse, then you should give it to the police. But that - frankly, that wasn't happening.", "I mean, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The bishops were not turning over abusers to the police, and so I think they were looking at Vatican policy and saying, you know, maybe we need to keep this quiet.", "Mm-hmm. Josh, thanks very much for the phone call, appreciate it.", "The - some defenders of the institution say, wait a minute. This isn't fair. You're having some states like New York trying to extend civil liability for child abuse cases for an additional period of years. In effect, this only covers Catholic schools. You can't sue public school teachers because they're protected by sovereign immunity. And there's just as many of these abusers in public schools as there are in Catholic schools.", "Yeah, I guess that's an interesting argument. I don't know what to - really, what to say about it except that, you know, if they - if there hadn't been so much abuse, maybe there wouldn't be -and so much cover-up, maybe there wouldn't be these moves for these kind of changes in the law.", "Let's go next to Becky, and Becky's with us from Charlotte.", "Hi.", "Hi, Becky. Go ahead, please.", "Well, I'm a Baptist in Charlotte - hold on, I have a truck going past me right now. It's very loud. Let me slow down. And the pastor in our church actually was accused of abuse of teenage girls, and it seemed to have made the news for a few days, and then everything just got quiet about it.", "There was nothing really ever said anymore, except that the families of the girls no longer attend our church. And it seems to me in looking at it - and I have to say my husband is Catholic, and so we talk about this quite a bit - but it seems to me that because the Catholic Church is so organized and so wealthy, that that is why everybody seems to go after it.", "You know, if you have a single pastor in a parish - I'm sorry, in a Baptist church that is accused, there's really nothing to go after. And the girls...", "Oh, that they don't have the assets to pay a big settlement, is what you're saying.", "Absolutely.", "Gosh, I mean, that's a really, really interesting thought, and I know that the Vatican has believed that, also. However, there have been, since 1950, 11,000 accusations of abuse by - on the part of, I think, something like 4,000 priests. That's...", "Well, when you look at the unity of the Catholic Church and how it's this one giant organization, and every little...", "Oh, it would deny that it's one giant organization. It's a series of archdioceses.", "Right.", "But, you know, all these individual little churches all across the rest of the world, how many accusations have there been there? No one keeps count because they're not the same huge, unified entity.", "Well, because they are relative, much smaller organizations, there could be cases of abuse that are covered up, but not...", "But probably not quite as many.", "And not on an institutional scale.", "Right. I mean, when you look at the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, they settled with over 500 victims for $660 million. And, you know, you don't - it's such a large organization, but also it's not just that it's a large organization. What people have been able to show is that bishops actually transferred priests around.", "They transferred abusers. You don't have that with an individual church. You don't have - and you don't have, you know, in, say, the Dominicans transferring a Dominican priest from one state to another, from one country to another. What you have is much more of a sense of organization in the cover-up than you can possibly have in an individual church where, you know, once a pastor is outed as being an abuser, he's outed as being an abuser, and no one is really covering it up.", "Becky, thanks very much for the call. Drive carefully. Here's a -by the way, our staff looked up on the Internet: A synagogue official deported from Canada after mailing child pornography to an undercover FBI agent in Southern California was sentenced in Los Angeles, Monday, to 15 months in federal prison, this from the Los Angeles Times in March of 1999. Stuart Friedman, who served as a cantor of a synagogue, must also undergo three years of supervised release after finishing his prison term. U.S. District Judge Carlos R. Moreno said he pleaded guilty in November to one count of distributing child pornography. So that's a verification of the case from the caller we had earlier.", "Here's an email who wishes to remain anonymous from Cincinnati: I can say with certainty that, no, the Catholic Church is not different than other organizations. I grew up a Jehovah's Witness, and the way it is handled is much the same. Elders are simply moved to other congregations, and the families are told not to pursue criminal charges. Knowledge of this from friends who were abused are part of the reason I discontinued that religious path. The only reason the Catholic Church is different because they have more money and power and, therefore, are a bigger target.", "Well, that's interesting. The Jehovah's Witness is apparently a little bit more hierarchical than many other religions like - other denominations like the Baptists or whatever. But you did - and I should say you do see this on a smaller scale in other religions. We just haven't seen it - in other denominations, but we just haven't seen it on the scale that we have in the Catholic Church. But that's a really, really interesting point.", "Here's an email, another one. This one from Cynthia in Harrisonburg, Virginia: In the Episcopal Church, all clergy and all who work with children are required to take a training course in the prevention of child sexual abuse. In Virginia, where I'm an Episcopal priest, clergy are, by state law, mandated reporters - that is, if I observe or I'm told about possible child sexual abuse, I must report to Child Protective Services. No system is perfect, but the training we get is quite good.", "And that's a really good point. That lets me say something nice about the Catholic Church, which is since 2002, they have put in a series of reforms - among them, training people, everyone, to be able to recognize sexual abuse, even training the kids, you know, about what should and shouldn't happen. And so we have seen a number of reforms.", "We see zero tolerance, where the Catholic Church says that if a priest is accused of abuse, they will pull him out of ministry immediately until they can figure out if the charges are correct, the allegations are correct or not. So we are beginning to see, since 2002, some changes, and a lot of dioceses do it very well. And, you know, we'll have to find out in the long term whether the Catholic Church and other churches are truly reformed or not.", "We're talking with NPR religion correspondent Barbara Bradley Hagerty. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "And again, just getting back to that caller we had earlier. A cantor, you might say, what's his - we're hearing information: Cantors usually train bar mitzvah boys. So that's their access to children.", "Right. A crime of opportunity, so to speak.", "In any case. Let's see if we can go next to - this is Susan, Susan with us from Nashville.", "Yes, hello. I was listening to what you were saying about the Roman Catholic Church being the church that, you know, can be most liable for this other than - than any other religious institution.", "Or bigger target, is what people are saying.", "Right. And what I wanted to say was I was actually an ordained Methodist minister and had a horrendous experience with the district superintendents, which control the flowing and the appointments of the Methodist ministers in the Methodist church. And they actually sent a pedophile minister to minister with me - which I didn't know at the time, of course.", "But later, when people came to me and told me about the previous charges over a 20-year span, and the district superintendents had knowledge of this and had taken this person and moved him around in the church in different congregations. And so what I wanted to say was the Catholic Church does not only have the corner on the market for this.", "I actually went to an attorney and went to sue them under the RICO Act because they fully, in full knowledge, knew. For 20 years, they moved this man around, but he was such a - had such a huge personality and was able to raise enormous amounts of money for building campaigns and other things and was also connected with some very high-up bishops, that it was just a horrible, horrible situation. So I just want to make it clear. It's not just the Catholic Church.", "Well, that...", "That's a really great point. And, you know, one of the through lines you see with a lot of these abusive priests is they tend to be very charismatic, larger-than-life people. In fact, Marcial Maciel, who is the head of the Legionaries of Christ, was a good friend of Pope John Paul II. He abused everything that walked - I mean, literally. I'm not exaggerating. He was a huge money raiser for the Catholic Church.", "Well, let me tell you something else. This is really interesting. He'd only been at the parish, like, two months. I'll never forget this, and there was something weird about him to me. He closed my door, knocked on the door and said, can I come in a minute? And then he came and shut the door and put his arm over me - I'll never forget this - over my shoulder and looked at me and he said, let me tell you something. And I won't say the word on the air, but it begins with a B. And he said, I'm in control here, and before you know it, you'll find out who's in charge here. And the people that I know - and I'll never forget. He said, don't tell anybody we had this conversation. Terrified me. He walks back out, and he sees one of the big parishioners and smiles and hugs him and they're going to go play golf together.", "Mm-hmm.", "So you're right. It's so terrifying...", "Well, in...", "...when you have an organization like bishops or district superintendents that have full knowledge and control this horrendous behavior.", "Well, thanks very much. That's an amazing story, Susan. We appreciate the phone call.", "Thank you.", "It's also true, teachers who are abusive, again, a lot of them have this - they're the most popular teacher in school.", "That's right. That's right. And they get away with it. And one thing I can say about Pope Benedict is he has been very quick. He's been really very good about removing abusive priests, like the head of the Legionaries of Christ. I mean, he get - I should say this: He gets it.", "From 2001, he began getting - when he was then Cardinal Ratzinger, he began getting all of the cases of abuse that were coming from America. And every Friday, every Friday afternoon, apparently, he would look through the stack of pile - stack of abusive - cases of abuse, and he would literally get sick. And I do believe, and most people do believe that he truly gets it about what a problem this is. And so when he became pope, he did institute some reforms. But it's hard to change the Catholic Church. It's a pretty old institution, and it's a pretty conservative one.", "One more thing, very quickly, and that is a lot of people say, wait a minute. You're talking about 1986 here. This is old stuff.", "It's, you know, the - a lot of the abuse occurred in the '60s and '70s, I'll say that, in the United States. But the cover-up has been going on, when it's occurred, has been going on right into recent times. And, you know, it's only now that people are beginning to come forward -people - especially in 2002 and later - when they came forward that you began to look at the actions of the bishops. And you saw that it wasn't just about the abuse. It was about moving around priests and covering it up. And that is a recent phenomenon.", "Two aspects: sexual abuse and the cover-up. Barbara Bradley Hagerty, thank you very much for your time today.", "It's been fun to be here.", "NPR's religion correspondent Barbara Bradley Hagerty.

You know, after his nationalist League Party formed this very unlikely alliance with the anti-establishment Five Stars Movement, which is the biggest party in parliament, Salvini quickly took over the government agenda. Five Stars went along with his tough anti-immigrant measures.

Asia has some of the world's fastest growing economies. It's also going to account for a huge portion of economic growth in the years to come as Europe slows down. And, of course, in geopolitical terms, the U.S. wants to serve as sort of a counterweight in this region to China's growing power.", "It's going to be repositioning some military assets to Asia.

That's a country that has seen pretty dramatic changes over the past year.", "Yeah. Change, as the president said, would have been almost unimaginable two years ago. Who would have thought back then that Aung San Suu Kyi would be in parliament instead of under house arrest? A number of political prisoners have been released in Myanmar.", "So the president's meeting with the leaders in that country, both the government leaders and the opposition leaders, is both to recognize the efforts Myanmar has made towards democratic reform, but also to say, look, there's still a long way to go. There are still prisoners being held in that country. There are still ethnic conflicts that have resulted in tens of thousands of people being displaced.", "So the administration says they want to both recognize the progress that's been made but also put a marker down on what Myanmar still needs to do.", "This is the president's first foreign trip since he won re-election two weeks ago. How does that factor into what he says or how he's received in some of these countries?", "Well, you know, when he meets with these East Asian leaders in Cambodia later this week, he'll be one of the few who's not a lame duck. China has been going through its own power transition. Both the U.S. and China have been somewhat internally focused during their own processes. But there's no question that President Obama is in a stronger position coming into this international meeting.", "He has four more years to focus on that goal of building the U.S. presence in Asia.

Congress still needs to do that before the end of the year. And then they hit a bump.", "A group of hardline conservatives in the House known as the Freedom Caucus are saying they could withhold their votes. They could vote against that stopgap spending bill, threatening a shutdown. And in exchange, they're trying to get some concessions from their leaderships to say that at the end of the year, they're not going to get jammed with a bunch of legislation they don't support because frankly that is what Congress tends to do when it's the last votes out of town before the Christmas holiday.", "Well, what are these conservatives concerned about?", "They have a lot of concerns. They focus mainly on three things. One, they're really worried about this deal that they need to reach on spending levels - is going to raise domestic spending too much. That's what Democrats want. They don't like that. They just want more money for defense, though it's important to note that they're going to need Democrats to pass any spending level deal, so they can't cut them out.", "There's also concern that they're going to reach a deal to pass immigration legislation specifically affecting what we call the DREAMers, the people who were brought here illegally as children who are now existing in this sort of legal limbo. They do not want that to happen, but there are talks in the Senate ongoing. That's a huge question mark for what Congress is going to do.", "And they really do not want to vote on any health care legislation. There were promises made to Maine Senator Susan Collins last week during that tax debate to get her vote in which she was told that Congress would pass two companion pieces of legislation that would essentially prop up the individual health care market because remember; the underlying tax bill effectively ends that individual mandate.", "OK, so if the House doesn't vote on those health care bills, does that mean Susan Collins could then vote against the final tax bill?", "It could. And she has said that those votes are conditional to her support for the tax bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised her both publicly and privately that Congress will vote on those bills before the end of this year. And I saw her in the hallway today, and I asked her if the speaker had given her similar assurances that the House would vote. And this is what she told me.", "I have had three conversations with the president of the United States about this, and I think he has quite a bit of influence with the House members.", "And she has a point. If President Trump comes out and says, look, guys; you need to do this to get the tax bill done, they will likely follow suit.", "All right, there's a big meeting at the White House this week with the big four, the top Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress. I mean, how big of a role does President Trump play in these negotiations?", "This is really critical. This is when presidential leadership really kicks in at these end-of-the-year negotiations. They need the White House to sign off on these spending levels or any immigration or health care deals because Republicans aren't going to bring to the bill - to floor any bills that won't be signed into law.", "And that's what - important part to remember here in these negotiations, is that Democrats really do pay - play a role. In order to get any of this done, they need bipartisan compromise in the Senate. Otherwise, Democrats could threaten a filibuster and block all of this.

Nice to have you on the program.", "Good afternoon.", "And it's important to remember these groups - you - we describe as the Afghan Taliban, are, as you describe, bad guys with a lot of American blood on their hands.", "Yes, they are. They really are bad guys. Just look at the way they ran Afghanistan when they were in charge. They could not have been more cruel. And you would think that that's reason enough for the Afghans themselves to fight like hell to defeat them. But, you know, the odd thing about this war is that we've become the main defenders of a free future for Afghans that they really ought to be defending for themselves.", "And the Obama administration - indeed, General Petraeus, who's now the military commander in Afghanistan - argue this is not the time to talk. We need to be in a stronger position, pummel the Taliban for a year or so, and then it might be time.", "That's basically the position of the administration, or at least - let me put it this way: Basically, the president - the position of president of the United States for Afghanistan, David Petraeus. The White House, I think, harbors - hopes that something could happen on this front. But basically, the White House goes along with the consensus that you don't start serious negotiations until you're in a stronger position.", "And so then what is our ally, Hamid Karzai, doing? Doing exactly that.", "Well, he is playing games that suit his own purposes. His main purpose right now is to try to deflect American pressure on him to reform his government, and every once in a while, we decided to get tough with him. And one way he has of diffusing our pressure is to threaten to talk to the Taliban, because he knows we don't want him to do that now.", "And he knows we don't want him to do it now? So this is to get leverage with Washington.", "I think that's the main aim. Because, look, he understands full well that if he were to make any kind of deal with the Taliban on the issue that the Taliban demands most - namely withdrawal of all U.S. and NATO forces right away. If he were to make any kind of deal like that, he would be out of power the next day.", "Similarly, it seems unlikely the Taliban are likely to agree to the principal U.S. demand, which is that they renounce violence and renounce al-Qaida.", "You got it. So each side right now is making demands that the other side is entirely likely to reject.", "So why are the various Taliban elements - if all of them are there at the table - why are they talking? They can just play for time, they think.", "Yeah. I think they're talking - or at least some elements of the Taliban are talking. There's so many different Taliban groups. They're talking in order to create mischief, to create the notion in the minds of some Afghans that there might some deal reached to try to soften up the opposition. And they may be doing it, as well, to try to entice American opponents of the war.", "So to engender opposition to the war in the United States.", "Yeah. Or to make people feel that if we made a - the United States made a more generous offer to the Taliban, that some deal might be workable.", "Another player in the game, of course, Pakistan, which seems to be on both sides.", "Well, at least on both sides. The Paks are the most difficult to understand and the easiest to understand in all of this. You would think, given all the public rhetorical explosions they make about the need for the United States to stay in Afghanistan to see that war through, that they would be strong backers of the United States. But, in fact, they tell us to stay in Afghanistan endlessly and they provide a safe haven for the Taliban and al-Qaida in Pakistan. They give them protection. They give them aid. And in these negotiations, on the one hand, they seem to be telling the Taliban go to it, do it, but we've got to be there to check on you.", "And their interest on that side of the table - well, really, their interest on both sides of the table is the longer term gain.", "I think so. But their interest is so conflicted because, you know, they do want us to stay there. And they do have their connection, a very deep one, to the Afghan Taliban. So, you know, they're on both sides of that issue.", "Another player in the game, not a direct one, but the party sponsoring the talks is the gulf state of Abu Dhabi, which you suggested...", "(unintelligible)", "...might be the source of the story in the first place.", "That's right. They sponsored these talks, and they sponsored similar talks about a year ago. And mind you - and this is the measure of how serious these talks are - the press is allowed to sit in the room while the talks are going on. And some of the participants described the talks more as an academic seminar than as a negotiation. And I think that probably captures the spirit of the thing.", "So is there a time when it is going to be a - you suggest the cynics are right and given that context, it's likely that not much is going to emerge from these talks. But will there be a time when talks might be productive? And what would be the conditions then?", "Yeah. There almost always has to be - there's always has to be talks at some point, unless you're dealing with a real devil, somebody like a Hitler, and there's no making a deal with them. There's just looking after your own interests as best you can. But in this case, I think, there eventually will be talks.", "And look, every time we've been involved in some kind of clash, we end up talking to the other side. We talked to the North Koreans in order to have a ceasefire in the Korean War. And Vietnam, you know, we fought almost for a decade there. And Bob Gates is in Vietnam right now, and we're talking about joint military maneuvers - joint military maneuvers - with Vietnam against China. If we had understood anything about Vietnam years ago, we would have understood that they considered China their biggest adversary then, not just now.", "So, you know, there's a lot about these - in these countries, these cultures we don't begin to understand here. Americans aren't good in understanding what goes on in other countries. But at some point, if we are to extricate ourselves from Afghanistan while protecting our real interests there, it's going to involve talking to the Taliban devil.", "And you suggest General Petraeus - there's a telling quote about him sitting down to talk with people in Iraq who eventually helped the United States a great deal.", "Exactly. I mean General Petraeus is one tough-minded guy. And even he said, when it came down to the wire in Iraq, you had to talk to the people who you were fighting if you wanted to get some deal that allowed us to extricate ourselves. And he said, you know, in the end, we're going to - we'll have to do that in Afghanistan as well. But I think it's got to be part of a strategy of protecting our interests there over the long run without fighting a major land war. That is what has to be in our head in order to be able to make a deal with the Taliban.", "You also point out domestic politics, of course, plays a role on all sides for Afghan President Karzai, for the Pakistanis, for the Taliban, certainly and...", "That's what foreign policy is mainly about. Foreign policy is the extension of domestic politics by...", "You're rewriting Clausewitz here.", "Yes.", "But there's also an element of American domestic politics as well. You write that the hawks in the United States are very worried by the prospect of these talks and the idea that important American national interests may be sold out.", "Yeah. I mean, the problem with our debate on Afghanistan policy is that it hasn't been a serious debate at all. You know, in the first place, when we went in there 10 years ago - almost 10 years ago -there was good reason. Afghanistan was the home for the al-Qaida people who attacked us. So, sure, let's go in and get them.", "But all of the sudden, revenge, proper revenge turned into a major land war. And here we are, almost 10 years later, and what used to be the center of a threat to the United States, the terrorist threat to the United States in Afghanistan has now morphed so that that threat is even more serious from other parts of the world, from Pakistan, from Sudan, from Yemen, from Jersey City. So we have to really rethink the reasons for fighting in Afghanistan. It was once a very important interest. It's no longer anything resembling a vital interest in a war against terrorism.", "But there still will be a residual threat. And I think we have to figure out how to get our troops there down to a small and sustainable level to deal with that residual threat and begin to focus our energies on now the worldwide terrorist threat.", "Yet, some would argue that, indeed, we don't need necessarily to deal with the threat in Afghanistan so much as the threat that a defeat or a vacuum there would pose to Pakistan, a country which has nuclear weapons.", "I know. And I get that response every time I say what I just said to you, that, well, the war really isn't in Afghanistan. It's in Pakistan. And my answer to them is, sure, I think Pakistan is probably the country that represents the biggest threat to world peace and the safety of our friends and allies. It's a highly unstable country with a large extremist group and 100 nuclear weapons and building much more. So, you know, what do we do about that? I say to them, what are we going to do? They say, well, we'll work with them to create stability. We'll give them economic aid. It's a country of 180 million people that can't begin to govern itself and we're going to fix it up? That just won't happen.", "You know, and I think the best way to deal with the Pakistanis is to try to help the moderate group in that country by asking them what can we do to help strengthen your position. But if it involves any kind of open-ended stay in Afghanistan, I don't see how that begins to help the position of moderates in Pakistan. I don't get the connection.", "Leslie Gelb, thank you for your time today. Appreciate it.", "Sure.", "Leslie Gelb, president emeritus at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Arif Lalani is Canada's ambassador to Afghanistan. He's in Washington this week and joins us in our studio. Good morning.", "Good morning.", "Canadian troops have been under fire in Kandahar since the war heated up back in 2006. What are you seeing there now?", "You're quite right. We have been there right from the beginning, which maybe a lot of your listeners don't know. But we went in with you in 2001, when the air operations started, and we've been in Kandahar for the last period. And it is probably some of the toughest real estate in the country to be holding, and that's reflected in our casualty levels.", "But it's also because we have been very active in trying to stabilize and secure Kandahar since we've been there.", "When Canada agreed just recently to extend its mission until 2011, one of its main demands was that another NATO country had to send in at least 1,000 troops to help out. In the end it turns out those troops will be U.S. Marines coming into Kandahar. Are the Canadian troops overwhelmed?", "Absolutely not. We had an independent commission to look at what was working and what wasn't working in terms of the mission in Afghanistan. And one of the things they concluded was that in Kandahar, being so crucial to the mission, we needed more troops to do the job right.", "But getting down to it, how much progress has been made in fighting the Taliban down in Kandahar?", "There's a lot of progress. Remember this is a country that for a whole generation, for 30 years, has had some kind of war or civil war, so progress sometimes means a gravel road. In Kandahar we're building new schools, training and hiring new teachers.", "So while life for the foreigners entails different security precautions, we shouldn't forget that life for Afghans is returning to normal.", "Although this gets us to the question of protest. In Canada, much of the protest about sending troops to Afghanistan stems from the fact that a lot of Canadians thought that when those troops went into Afghanistan they were going to reconstruct the country. It was a sort of a peace mission and then they ended up fighting. How much has the mission changed to allow your troops to actually concentrate on reconstruction?", "We're concentrating more and more. I've been ambassador there for a year now, and in the year that I've been there we have done more development in Kandahar this year than we did last year. But you're also quite right to point out that this is a leadership in a way that Canada hasn't experienced since the Korean War. And that kind of leadership, I think, has taken some adjustment for Canadians.", "But Canadians, frankly, you know, have not really been protesting against the war. There's been a lot of political debate about the direction of the mission.", "Well, I take your point. It's not so much protest on the streets but there certainly is a constant drum roll in Canada of criticism about Afghanistan in a way that we don't see that here. More like what we see here about Iraq.", "Exactly. And I think partly it's because our Afghanistan mission is our number one foreign policy priority. What you're seeing is natural because we have never done anything this big, and frankly with this kind of loss of life. So Canadians, I think, are adjusting due to the fact that Americans are used to, which is that leadership isn't always easy.", "Arif Lalani is Canada's ambassador to Afghanistan, in Washington, D.C. this week.

There was a separate bench trial immediately after the main trial in which the judge rendered a verdict and he also found Ken Lay guilty.", "So what happened in the courtroom as the verdicts were read?", "You know, it's kind of hard - we were actually in the auxiliary courtroom watching on a screen.

They didn't ask for a lot more material. They made very few requests, so it was difficult to know what was going through their minds. I have to say that just, there was a pretty widespread view among the reporters and other people following the trial that these convictions were going to come down, that the prosecution had a very strong case. You had a number of executives from the company who were given immunity deals to testify. They came in, they testified that both Skilling and Lay, Ken Lay knew about what was going on, and even condoned the use of these accounting gimmicks to cover up the losses.", "I mean it was very strong testimony.

Among the many things on his resume, he trained the new Iraqi Army's non-commissioned officers in the summer of 2003.

There's still rumors about Dawud Al-Baghdadi being seen here and down there, and so he still lives.", "William McCallister, who has partnered with Scholl on many of his projects, was a military advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority, or CPA. Ambassador Paul Bremmer was the head of the CPA. McCallister was responsible for reaching out to the tribes and he quickly got frustrated with the Americans.

As for the, quote, emancipating the individual from the oppressive tribal system, McCallister points out that in Iraq it is the tribal hierarchy over the group and the group over the individual that defines Iraqis, something he says the U.S. military has never fully grasped and all too often responded to with force. Iraq, says McCallister, is a skein of dominant tribal systems and sub-tribes dating back centuries, predicated on the harsh conditions of land and water and grazing rights and trading. Personal standing is paramount for negotiations to take place.", "In this country, it's a zero sum game. We can't make the pie bigger. There are only so many grazing areas in a desert or rocky area. There are only so many water sources. There are only so many assets that a tribe can gain and that's one of the functions of the tribal sheikh, is to be able to gain access to patronage.", "And that is why, says McCallister, that the traditional counter-insurgency doctrine of winning hearts and minds doesn't work. McCallister favors something even more basic: understanding a cultural concept he calls shame and honor and respect. These concepts have a different meaning, he says, in Iraqi tribal culture. The concept of shame and honor is as important as land and water.", "Shame and honor in essence is a finite resource. It's a coin, it's a currency, and it is traded as such. Whereas we in the West will talk about baking a bigger pie. There's always more to go around. That's not the case here. So if I, by giving a soccer ball, by building a new school, the way I am interpreted by an Iraqi is that I am gaining honor because, look at me, look at what I am doing. I'm going honor at his expense, so I am giving him some of my shame, in return taking some of his honor and adding it to my store of honor. And if we understand that, maybe we would not focus so much on hearts and minds and focus more on shame and honor, and from that, tolerance.", "From his part, David Scholl claims to have gone to extremes. At least as Dawud Al-Baghdadi. He speaks of having been beaten in Iraqi detention and then having tea with his captors. He says he's bartered for compensation for the U.S.-caused death of an Iraqi teen and then being treated by the family as a son. But for all the investment of U.S. time, military might and money, says this former Special Forces soldier, he says it's too late for the U.S. military to act this way.", "It's not getting better because the situation three years ago, two years ago, and maybe even a year ago, doesn't exist today. When we started, we were the occupier and we were in charge. As time transitioned, what the Iraqi people think of when they look at Americans and who they think we are, it's all changed dramatically, and we don't have the prestige or the promise. We don't have the carrots and we don't have the big sticks. The mission is different, the threat is different. Everything about today is different, but winning honor and respect with the Iraqis, that's not really a job for the military anymore.", "And if the opportunity for the military to affect the outcome of the war has passed, Scholl hopes that the ancient art of negotiating still must have a chance for success. Not on American terms but perhaps on ones Iraqis understand and value.", "They tell us how it is to negotiate with them, how to be successful, what they want and what they don't want. We didn't listen. We came in with a different set of rules, coming in and talking about a utopian democracy that's going to point the way for a new Middle East, things that had no basis in reality whatsoever. If we would then and if we will now understand the society that we're dealing with, we will be able to understand that we're not in charge here. The problem in Iraq today is not the fault of the United States military. It's not going to be resolved by United States military. We're not in control, but we are a player.

That's at npr.org, click on TALK OF THE NATION.", "NPR sports correspondent Mike Pesca joins us now from our bureau in New York, and nice to have you back, Mike.", "Hi.", "And the careers of these two pitchers are as different as the pitches they throw.", "Yeah. Tim Wakefield was a very good pitcher in the beginning of his career. And then for the last - for five of the last seven years, statistics show he's been slightly above average. This year and last year, he's quite been - he's quite markedly been a below-average pitcher. But along the way, he's picked up 200 wins, which used to not be that much of a milestone. But in modern baseball, it is. In fact, it makes him among all active pitchers, the only one with 200 or more wins, and he got his 200th last night. And the reason for that is that pitchers are - and he does it with a knuckleball. And the reason why wins are in such short supply is the bullpen has become more prominent in baseball.", "And if you want to talk about prominent bullpens, Mariano Rivera is the closer par excellence. He is two things: dominant and resilient. He has never had a bad year. He has played for 17 seasons - 16 full seasons. And he is the anchor of a Yankee team that has been the best team in baseball over his career. And every Yanker - Yankee player will tell you, without Mariano Rivera as that threat to come in at the end of the game with his one pitch, the cutter, they would not have won all those World Series.", "And along the way, the epitome of class and professionalism, never shows up another ball player, comes in calmly to do his work and, just as calmly, executes his pitch, which bores in on left-handed hitters, bores away from right-handed hitters. They know it's coming. They can't hit it.", "Right. But they're the only ones who's bored because the stadium is usually rocking when Mariano is there. And you want to talk about respect. David Ortiz, who should be Mariano's biggest rival, says, I respect him like my father. And if you want to talk about pitchers, they can't believe the guy because, in a way, he's totally unlike other pitchers. Not just that he's better, but that he only uses one pitch. And when we say only, he - his save against Seattle, I have it right here. I have the pitch log. He had 15 pitches in that save the other night, and 12 of them were cutters. The other three were four-seam fastballs.", "Now what a cutter is. Imagine you're inside the head of Mariano. You're looking for his eyes, and he's a right-hander. He throws it, and it's fast. It's not as fast as the fastest fastballs in the game. It's about 93 miles an hour. But at the end, it moves sharply to the left. In days of your baseball, Juan Marichal was said to throw a hard slider, and they used to call it a hard slider. But Mariano kind of invented this pitch or had it invented.", "He thinks he was just touched by God because the ball started happening one day after he was already happening - the movement started happening one day after he was already in the Major Leagues. He was the first right-hander to really throw this pitch. It's since become a very popular pitch, and high school kids and college players are all trying to acquire a cutter. No one is acquiring it as good as Mariano has it.", "But the kind of question is, you know, the glory of baseball. And the interesting thing about pitchers is the mental game. What pitch do you throw? Where do you place it? When do you go to the curve? When do you try to pull the hitter? Mariano has none of that. So, in a way, you could say what he does is blunt force, and it's less interesting. But it's kind of more interesting in the way you could say that, yeah, Stradivarius only did one thing. He made a bunch of violins, never made a tuba. But so what? He's such a craftsman that it's an amazing thing to behold.", "And I hope that when he's elected to the Hall of Fame on the first ballot, which he will be, the plaque has his nickname - not The Sandman, which is the tune they play when he comes in - but the other nickname that is sometimes applied to him, The Hammer of God.", "Because he is a Godly man who always credits God for all his skills. Something has kept him healthy all these years because great pitchers come and go and the arm tires. Tim Wakefield is in his early 40s, and one of the reasons is that the knuckleball is far less taxing on the arm. And I think - and this has been less explored than the knuckleball phenomenon in keeping pitchers healthy, but I think the fact that Mariano never turns his wrist when throwing the cutter - so he's only throwing fastballs and cutters, and he doesn't have much wrist motion. That's got to be one of the things that kept - that has kept him healthy so as off-season conditioning. Luck plays a big factor. Mariano will tell you God plays a big factor.", "We want to hear from listeners about one-trick pony's people and otherwise - positions that otherwise demand versatility who get by, indeed, excel with one particular aspect of those skills: 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. We'll start with Steve, and Steve's with us from New Mexico.", "Hey, good morning. We're on the road, driving to New Mexico. And, you know, Trevor Hoffman, who's the all-time saves leader, his one pitch that got him out of most of everything was the changeup. You know, the key to it was having that same motion, you know, to not expect if you were getting the fastball, which diminished, you know, in his later years. But that changeup, that one pitch got him that - saves, you know, most saves of all time.", "Six hundred one saves. And he is, indeed, the all-time saves leader, at least until tonight, maybe, when Mariano Rivera may tie him. But, Mike Pesca, you have to throw the occasional fastball to set up the changeup.", "Right. That's the whole deal with the changeup. The changeup, for those not versed in it, is a pitch that looks exactly like the fastball but then comes in at a different speed. And Hoffman was great at actually differing his speeds. So people think that for a pitcher to be good or to have - to be a good fastball pitcher, all he has to do is bring speed, and that's actually a misunderstanding. What you have to do is bring a little bit of speed but be able to take just enough off it at times so that the hitter can't time the pitch.", "And when we say that Hoffman's changeup was among the most devastating pitches in baseball history, it was. But, of course, you had to throw the fastball. In the beginning of Hoffman's career, he could get 95 miles an hour on the gun. Then he began to lose his fastball - best thing that ever happened to Trevor Hoffman, because that's when he really started to learn that changeup.", "But when we talk about best pitches in baseball history, you know, Sandy Koufax's curve or Steve Carlton's curve or Dwight Gooden's curve, these are all because you have the other pitch or in some cases, two or three other pitches, to make a curve ball stand out so much and so difficult to hit. It's the contrast between the pitches, whereas Mariano Rivera, there's no contrast. It's just one pitch. It's in a little bit of a different category. But you're right, Hoffman's changeup was an extraordinary pitch.", "Thanks for the call, Steve. Drive carefully. We got two nominees - two email writers: John in Salt Lake City and this is from Don, both of whom nominate Elroy Face back in the old Pirates days, who threw pretty much the forkball and the forkball and the forkball.", "Right. Now, he was a one-trick pony, but he was not nearly as good and he was - never came to whiff the Hall of Fame. Another guy who is a Hall of Famer, you know, Hoyt Wilhelm's knuckleball. He was a combination of Wakefield and Mariano, because he was a relief pitcher for most of his career but he threw a knuckleball. So he also had a very long career just like Tim Wakefield and Mariano.", "The forkball - another way to throw a changeup by wedging the ball back in your fingers and then throwing with the same motion as the fastball, but it dives down right there at the end and a little bit change of speed as well. Let's see if we can go next to Dave, and Dave with us from Buffalo.", "Hi, Neal. Thanks a lot.", "Go ahead, please.", "I'm a guitar player. And, obviously, when the first Van Halen album came out in 1979, we were all blown away by Eddie Van Halen's right hand technique, which is threading the notes with both his left and his right hand. And other players had done that previous, and many players have done that since. But to most of your listeners, they're all going to be obscure instrumentalist. And while Eddie is, you know, a great personality and a superb musician, he pretty much has done the whole - the same thing the whole time.", "Which is why I don't know why there's no reliever that doesn't enter into \"Eruption,\" which is Eddie Van Halen's signature solo. Or some - how about Yngwie Malmsteen? We could talk guitarists if you want.", "Oh, absolutely. He's great. That's another one. Yngwie Malmsteen is - what's his name, Rob Johnson down from Texas? They're primarily instrumentalists, and they just haven't got the mainstream, you know, the mainstream success that Eddie had.", "I think we just compared cutters to shredders.", "Thank you very much.", "Dave, thanks very much for the call. Let's go next to - this is Reese, and Reese with us from Laramie, Wyoming.", "Thanks, Neal. Appreciate it. I'd like to suggest David Beckham. Not many guys you don't pitch like Ryan, you don't dunk like Jordan, but you bend it like Beckham.", "You bend it like - he owns that phrase, in part, because of that movie, but Mike Pesca, the bend it was referring to his skill at what's called in soccer, set pieces, where it's a free kick and he can bend the ball around the wall of defenders and pass the goalie's hands. He was also a highly skilled player in the midfield.", "Right. And so the cross-sport comparison is kind of difficult when it comes to basketball or soccer or a sport where all the players play offense and defense and the sport flows. Sure, in basketball, there are three point specialists, shot-blocking specialists, like Manute Bol and Mark Eaton, but don't guys don't ever get seen of as great all-around players. They're not in the Hall of Fame in the NBA. But, of course, Mariano will be in the Hall of Fame.", "Baseball is one of the few sports where a specialist can be one of the best. And I was thinking, is it true in football? I mean, Ray Guy is a great punter, and some say he should be in the Hall of Fame, but he isn't. I believe Garo Yepremian, as a kicker, is in the Hall of Fame, and that's really a specialist. Long snappers will never make the Hall of Fame.", "(Unintelligible) a position that's not expected to do more than one thing to begin with.", "One right.", "Garo Yepremian once tried to throw the ball. We saw what happened there.", "He does say that is the most famous play, when he bobbled that Super Bowl throw. But you know what? I was thinking about this. I think, in a way, Randy Moss, the great receiver who's - this is his first year out of football. He might stay retired. He didn't do much more than what they call go routes or fly patterns. Sure, he could run a crossing route - but basically, Randy Moss went long and came down with the ball. And he has the best statistics of receivers this side of Jerry Rice, and he's got to make the Hall of Fame. So maybe you can make the case that Randy Moss is a sort of one-trick pony who came to dominate his position in sport.", "Let's see if we can get one more caller in. We're talking with Mike Pesca, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "And let's go to Chuck, and Chuck's with us from Berkeley in California.", "Hi, there. Thanks for taking my call.", "Sure.", "Funny that it was follow-up with the basketball in the Hall of Fame analogy. I was thinking of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the sky hook. He's actually in the Hall of Fame, and he's - he was all-around player, but nobody could stop that shot from left side or the right side. Nobody can stop it, and they knew it was coming.", "And Kareem, of course, in the Hall of Fame for more than just that, Mike Pesca.", "Absolutely. The rebounds too...", "Right. Right. So if the question is who has an unstoppable - who could repeat an unstoppable, bold, physical feat, Kareem and Mariano are very similar in that, that everyone knew the sky hook was coming, and there was nothing you could do about it. At their height, you know, certain boxers maybe can fit in that category. But, of course, Kareem was an all-around player and could pass and could rebound and was the points leader, so, yeah, a great player beyond the sky hook.", "Chuck, thanks very much for the nomination.

Instead, these two legislators inserted language like the Hong Kong nation and used four-letter words in English that I cannot say on the radio when they were supposed to say China.

Even though Britain handed over Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing, at that time, agreed to ensure the people of Hong Kong special freedoms and autonomy for the next 50 years.

This is bigger than the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. This is a phenomenon that has a global significance. I know people are dealing about this very seriously across the - across the globe. How do you prevent the recruitment of young people to this sort of extreme violence? And it's a challenge I think for us all. I hope we find solutions. At the moment, it's important that we play our part in beefing up defense.

There is this issue surfacing about the Israeli response and the fact that the death toll among the Palestinians is quite high. It's so much higher at this point.

Israeli police are only allowed to use their weapons - they can only use deadly force in life-threatening situations. Those rules are clear.

Here's the question at issue: if you charge your boss with discrimination, under what circumstances can you also sue for retaliation?", "The court's decision could affect tens of thousands of employment cases and could affect retaliation claims brought under dozens of other federal laws. Here's NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg.", "The nation's civil rights laws bar not only discrimination, but also retaliation against employees who filed discrimination charges. Today's case tests what kind of employer actions are considered retaliation under the law. The case was brought by Sheila White, a 5-foot, 1-inch mother of three, who at age 41 went to work for the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad Company. On her previous job, she'd been a forklift operator and she says she was hired for the same task at Burlington Northern, the first woman hired to work on the tracks.", "Burlington Northern says she was hired for a mix of track duties, including forklift operator. Two months into her job, she complained to company officials that she was being sexually harassed. Her supervisor was suspended for ten days and she was reassigned.", "I was told the very same day that I would no longer be operating the forklift. They were putting me on the railroad tracks.", "That meant lifting hundred-pound jackhammers, hauling rocks, jumping on and off trains, constant travel, and longer hours. She filed a retaliation claim with the EEOC, and a week later she was suspended for insubordination. She challenged the suspension; 37 days later, a company hearing officer ruled in her favor and reinstated her with back pay.", "That 37 days were the worst days I want to think of. Two children in school, and I was the supporter, and no income coming in at all.", "The Company's position is that the reinstatement with back pay made White whole.", "Carter Phillips represents Burlington Northern.", "At the end of it, she ended up precisely where she would have been otherwise.", "A federal jury didn't agree, awarding White $43,000 dollars to compensate her for illegal retaliation by her employer.", "A federal appeals court upheld the award, ruling, among other things, that White's forklift job, though technically in the same job category as a track worker, was in fact an entirely different, physically easier job, and that by permanently removing her from the forklift job, as well as suspending her, the company had retaliated against her.", "Today, Burlington Northern's Mr. Phillips will tell the Supreme Court the lower court was wrong.", "Our argument there is that that's not the right way to characterize it. She was hired as a laborer. She applied for the job of laborer. She didn't apply for the job of forklift operator. There wasn't such a job at the time.", "Phillips will tell the high court that Congress did not intend to authorize retaliation lawsuits unless there's been some change in the conditions or privileges of employment, some act involving hiring, firing, promotion, demotion, acts which typically have an economic effect on an employee.", "But Sheila White's lawyer, Donald Donati, counters that Congress never intended such a limit on retaliation suits.", "The reason is that retaliation comes in all types and forms. The only limitation is what the human imagination can devise.", "Burlington's Phillips responds that in the last twelve years the number of retaliation lawsuits has doubled from, 10,000 to 20,000, because increasingly trivial matters have become the subject of such lawsuits.", "Every slight, whatever that means, will be a source of retaliation. And if you adopt a standard that says that everything that is viewed as adverse by the employee is a basis for retaliation, the 100 percent increase in claims for retaliation that you've seen in the last few years will be a 1,000 percent increase.", "But Sheila White does not see her case as involving small slights.", "Small? I consider my complaints very large for all the abuse and harassment and treatment I have received out there. Day by day it went to a different level, higher and higher, where they were trying to force me out.", "And her lawyer, Mr. Donati, says some 42 other federal laws are modeled on this one, laws involving regulation of health, safety, even the securities industry, all laws written to protect from retaliation individuals who bring enforcement complaints.", "Without that protection the underlying statutes will be severely diminished, because it doesn't take much to have an individual intimidated and fearful about the consequences.

And job growth didn't just pick up last month. The Labor Department said payrolls increased more than first estimated in December and January, too. In the past three months alone, the economy has added nearly three-quarters of a million jobs. Cary Leahey is senior economist at Decision Economics.", "The economy was feared to be dipping into a recession last summer and lo and behold, the economic numbers generally improved. Things got perkier. And in particular, the U.S. labor market is starting to heat up.", "Today's report confirms what many economists have been saying for months, though the jobless rate is still uncomfortably high, there are unmistakable signs that the worst of the downturn is behind us. Although a gain of 227,000 jobs in a single month is not huge, it is enough, over time, to bring down the unemployment rate, albeit at a slow pace. Alan Krueger is chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisors.", "Today's report, combined with the past six months' report, as well as other data coming in, like unemployment insurance claims, show an economy on the mend. We are digging our way out of the deep hole that the president inherited when he took office.", "Despite the increase in payrolls, the overall U.S. unemployment rate stayed where it was at 8.3 percent. That was because of a sudden increase of nearly a half million people in the U.S. workforce. Some economists said that was something of a statistical fluke, but Gus Faucher, senior economist at PNC Financial Services, sees it as a positive sign.", "Although there was a big jump in the number of jobs, we actually saw a lot of people coming back into the labor force, people who'd given up and stopped looking for work and then started to look for work again.", "Faucher says the numbers today point to persistent, but moderate economic growth over the next two years. Of course, the U.S. economy appeared to be on the mend last year, too, only to get derailed by the Japanese earthquake and tsunami and the European debt crisis. Cary Leahey says something similar could happen this year. The rise in gasoline prices, in particular, is a worrisome sign. But Leahey says, the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand pressures in a way it wasn't last year.", "If you are generating these kinds of jobs and it improves people's confidence about the economy, then you have a greater case for a self-reinforcing recovery where better jobs lead to better spending and better spending leads to better jobs.", "And, Leahey says, this kind of recovery can be a powerful force for growth, generating optimism that feeds on itself.

You know, it      would be a whole thing.", "Whoopi Goldberg and Chris Rock join more than 100 comedians in      \"The Aristocrats.\"  Although, or maybe because, it pushes the envelope      beyond vulgar, the documentary earned rave reviews at this year's      Sundance Film Festival.  Bob Saget turned up in the movie with his own      smutty version.  It's a surprising performance from the man who played      the straight-arrow father on the family sit com \"Full House.\"  But      Saget's been in the world of stand-up comedy for a long time, long enough      to know where this joke wouldn't be welcomed.", "It's the kind of joke you wouldn't really give      to mass consumptions, not something you would tell on stage.

Supposedly,      Buddy Hackett was on \"The Tonight Show\" once and during the commercial      break told the audience and Johnny this joke and then told the punch line      when they came back from a commercial:  \"The Aristocrats.\"  It's not even      a good punch line.  Paul Reiser's hilarious.  He's kind of, `Is it \"The      Aristocrats?\"  Is it a Disney film?'  But it's the antithesis of that.      It is a joke about how desperate people would be to make it in show      business.", "One of the other interesting points here is ofttimes those of us      who are not comedians don't see the craft of comedy, particularly if you      get different people in the same room, you will be able to craft a joke      that started out one way and is a better joke in the end, is it not?", "It is.  It's--and if you can make a joke out of this joke,      you are quite a constructor.  But it's the gallows humor of it that make      it fascinating and to watch a comedian really love telling it.  George      Carlin launches into it, and he loves it because this man stands for      freedom of speech, started with the seven words you can't say on      television.  This movie is full of 400 things you can say on television.", "You get to play with people's little      danger zones.  I do like finding out where the line is drawn,      deliberately crossing it, bringing some of them with me across the line      and having them be happy that I did.", "Let me ask you this.  In relation to the times that we're in      now, so many people talk about whether or not we are in need of      censorship, whether or not we have allowed our society to go too far.      Where do you fall on that in relation to where we sit and, again,      juxtaposing it to this movie?", "Whenever we go to a very conservative time, obviously this      kind of stuff comes out.  And this is where extreme art comes from.  It's      been an interesting thing that this came out.  It does lower the bar in      some ways as far as it's so dirty that--dialoguewise.  There's no nudity.      There's no violence.  And in the ad campaign, Penn Gillette is saying,      `And no penguins.' But what's interesting about it is we live in a      society where this movie can get released.  And there's something I say      beautiful about it.  And it's--the movie's about censorship, too, and the      freedom of speech and bad language and sexual situations with people that      are reasonable people.  It is not damaging. My 18-year-old saw it.  She      was in a theater in Santa Monica.  She saw it with 600 people.  They were      laughing hysterically.  But she's not damaged.  She's smart.

NPR's David Welna reports on the outbreak of protectionist fever.", "This week, four Senate Democrats, led by New York's Charles Schumer, held a news conference at the Capitol.", "We're here today to discuss something so outrageous, it just makes your blood boil.", "The outrage, Schumer said, was that the Department of Energy was about to send a grant of nearly half a billion dollars in economic stimulus funds to a west Texas wind-farm project. He asserted the project would create a few hundred jobs in the U.S. - and 3,000 jobs in China.", "The stimulus is a golden opportunity, because it's dollars to buy those things and to say they have to be made here. China doesn't import our stuff when it's using its government's money. Why do we have to do that? Why are we sometimes, it seems, Uncle Sap, not Uncle Sam?", "Schumer said the problem was that Democrats forgot to include a buy- America clause for private firms receiving economic stimulus money. He called on the Obama administration to stop issuing grants until that loophole is closed. But administration officials dispute Schumer's allegations.", "At a Senate hearing yesterday, Energy Secretary Steven Chu was asked about the west Texas wind-farm project.", "Although that has gotten a lot of press coverage, we have not gotten an application for a wind farm made with China parts in Texas.", "Cielo Wind Power is the west Texas firm that's building that wind farm. Its president, Walt Hornaday, says while the windmills will be assembled in China by maybe 100 workers, 70 percent of their content will be American, and the same goes for more than 2,000 workers on the project.", "Hornaday says a buy-America provision is not needed.", "It just simply sends the wrong signal on our industry where you're trying to fix a problem that doesn't exist. If you already have 70 percent U.S. content in turbines and 90 percent U.S. content in the balance of the project, what problem are you trying to fix?", "Meanwhile, a bill was introduced in the House yesterday that would have the U.S. withdraw from NAFTA.

The Senate has already rejected some of the proposals on the table. But Republican leaders now appear to be focusing on what they're calling a, quote, \"skinny repeal.\" This is something that would roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act that are the most unpopular. We're going to get one perspective from the health care industry itself. Tom Nickels is the executive vice president of the American Hospital Association. He joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us, Mr. Nickels.", "Glad to be here.", "I imagine this perpetual ambiguity over health care is making your life rather stressful these days?", "These are busy times for sure. And things keep changing by the day. Things changed last night. And I'm sure they'll be different tomorrow than they are today.", "You represent thousands of hospitals. What's on the line for those facilities that you represent?", "Well, I think the most important thing for us and for my members is coverage, coverage of individuals under Medicare, coverage of individuals who purchase insurance on the markets. And that's what we've been completely focused on. And we'll keep being focused on it until this is over.", "Is there anything about this, quote, \"skinny repeal\" idea that you like?", "Well, looking at it on the merits, there are parts that we like. For example, they get rid of the Medicaid cuts, you know, in excess of $700 billion in cuts to the Medicaid program. And they don't roll back the expansion of the program. That's a positive move. On subsidies, they don't reduce the subsidies, practically $400 billion in the underlying bill. They don't do that either. So that's a plus and a recognition, I think, that those are not policies that can pass the Senate.", "However, there are also some downsides to it, which is the elimination of the individual mandate. And what will that do to the marketplace? Will it destabilize? And how many more people will lose their coverage? The other concern, of course, is we can look at the bill on the merits. That's one thing. But also, what is this in terms of a political move? This is potentially - and I think Senator Corker talked about this pretty publicly yesterday. This is potentially just an effort to get something passed to get to a conference with the House. And we have real, serious problems with the House bill.", "So talk about those. What is the most egregious part of the House bill, as you see it?", "Well, I think the most egregious part is Medicaid. And in two parts, one is, again, it rolls back the expansion of the Medicaid program, beginning on January 1st of 2020. And secondly, it completely restructures the Medicaid program into a per capita cap arrangement. And it's not so much that arrangement but the dollars that come out of the program in excess of $800 billion under the House bill. And to us, that is just untenable. And it will do significant harm to people who really need that coverage.", "We have seen an effort for a wholesale repeal of the Affordable Care Act. That didn't work. But if the substance of the Affordable Care Act or at least a significant part of it, the individual mandate goes away through something like a skinny repeal vote, what would be the consequences? I mean, that lowers the number of people who are paying into the system.", "Right. So I think you could look at two consequences right out of the box. The first is - and the Congressional Budget Office has said this - that potentially as many as 15 million people could drop coverage. Now, again, we'll need to see the CBO - a new number from them to know that for sure. This is a two-year-old piece of data. But that's the first problem. The second thing is what does it do to the market?", "Yeah.", "Because the whole notion is to have people, healthy people, sick people in between, all need to be in.

We are a dry state, the fifth driest in the country, and a low snowfall effects us throughout the year, right? It effects our water supply. It effects our fire season.", "And the problem with climate change - and I think this is why it's so difficult - is that while we experience its effects, it is so big as an idea that many of us have trouble wrapping our heads around it. And it's really hard to think of ways that we can solve the problem or make a difference. It's just - it's overwhelming.", "And sometime - I mean, so overwhelming you really don't know where necessarily to kind of explain it. I mean, obviously a lot of people listen to scientists and they make an incredibly compelling case, but she really struggles with that.", "Yeah, it is very, very difficult but certainly we here in Montana see the effects when it comes to fishing. Warmer water hurts the trout. And certainly those fire seasons, last summer in Bozeman in August, it was difficult to run or be outside.", "Let me bring in another voice here.

Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION.", "Joining us to explain it is NPR's senior Washington editor Ron Elving. Ron, good to see you.", "Good to be with you, Rebecca.", "So the president has released his budget. What do we know about it in the couple of hours we've had it?", "Well, we've had a chance to break it down really over a slightly longer period of time because most of the key elements of it had been leaked in advance. We know, as you said, that it's $3.7 trillion. That is almost one quarter, or equivalent to almost one quarter, of what is almost a $15 trillion annual economy in the United States. And so we are talking about some enormous, enormous numbers here. And the engines that drive both the spending of the federal government and the revenue gathering of the federal government are enormous fiscal engines. And...", "Like what?", "Well, we're talking about the ability to tax incomes. We're talking about the responsibility, on the federal government's part, to meet all the obligations that have been made by all the presidents and Congresses that have ever sat in Washington, and that includes all the military commitments that we have around the world. It includes the enormous obligations that have already been issued, trillions and trillions of dollars in debt going back four decades and - well, really going back all the way to the beginning of the Republic.", "And we also have an enormous number of promises that the federal government has made to all of us really. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, these are the enormous drivers that are moving money not just in billions anymore. Trillion is the new billion in Washington, and we now deal, regularly, in increments of a trillion dollars.", "So from what has been leaked on - the strategy of what is leaked and what is not is also interesting to talk about. But from what has actually made it to the public with time for some analysis and reflection, what are the highlights?", "One highlight, I think, is that the president is not attempting to do what everyone knows must be done on his own. He is saying I'm going to give you a budget that trims. We're going to, for example, put in a freeze on discretionary spending for the next several years so that that portion of the budget that the president and the Congress have the most control over would not grow. It would remain. And that would save a great deal of money over what would happen if it just naturally grew as much as it's been growing. So that's one way of saving some money.", "And we're also trying to restrain the amount of annual deficit so that that would come down by a trillion dollars over the next 10 years. That being, in some part, the saving of some of the debt service if we borrow a little less money. But we're still going to be servicing an enormous existing national debt. And that, I think, is getting an awful lot of attention. It's going to grow by another $7 trillion even if the president got his way with respect to these budget cuts.", "Now, the other thing, of course, that's very distracting - and you've already mentioned it - but it is terribly confusing, I think, for the average person who's trying to get - make some sense of the news coming out of Washington is that while we're talking about the president's budget, which is for fiscal year 2012, which begins next October 1st, next fall, we are also still struggling with the unfinished process of the current year budget which never really got done.", "They didn't really do the process the way they are supposed to do in 2010. It was a political year. It was a big struggle. There was an election. The appropriations bills didn't get done. And the federal government has been funding itself by a series of what are called continuing resolutions, which just freeze everything in place temporarily. Those do not make the changes in policy that people want to make. They don't make the changes in priorities that people want to make, but they keep the government up and running.", "The latest one expires on March 4th. And that could be a fiscal train wreck, as they like to say, if the president and the Congress can't get together about this year's spending. Forget 2012.", "Now, you talking about the priority changes that people want to make. It seems that there's a whole lot of deficit reduction talk going on this year. A lot of people were elected on that kind of rhetoric. First of all, give us a sense of the scope and the history of the deficit. And does this budget that -for 2012, the next budget, that came out this morning do much to address it?", "Well, the budget that came out this morning for 2012 is projecting that we could bring down the annual deficit, which for 2011 is projected now to be not just the one and a half trillion that we knew about. You know, here again, we didn't ever used to talk about trillions. But just in a very recent past we have moved into the trillions world. One point six trillion, that's the current projection for 2011. Bring that down all the way to 1.1 for 2012. Now, that's a big reduction, but it's still an enormous number, an unprecedented number. So that would be a step in the right direction.", "This deficit, as I say, has been with us in some measure or another back throughout the nation's history. But it has exploded in recent decades for a number of reasons, having to do with both cutting taxes and committing the country to a lot of different spendings, primarily military spending and those promises to individuals - Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Those are the big ones. And a certain amount of discretionary spending as well. But the discretionary is really the smallest child on this particular block, and the big ones are the others that I mentioned.", "That was actually brought under a species of control in the 1990s in mixed government, divided government - President Clinton, a Democrat, a very Republican Congress in the later years of the 1990s - and using the tax increases from the first President Bush and from President Clinton's first budget, and the spending cuts of the latter part of the 1990s, and most particularly using the breakneck economy, the runaway train of an economy we had in the late 1900s, especially in the dot-com boom, all those revenues came together with some spending cuts to project a balanced United States government budget for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003. And as soon as that money started to come in and produce a surplus, everything turned around.", "We had a recession. We had the 9/11. We had tax cuts. Because even before 9/11 happened, the president and the Congress, President Bush and his Congress at that time, felt that bringing in a surplus was not a good idea. We shouldn't be taxing people that much if it was bringing in a surplus. So they cut taxes.", "And, of course, revenues went south because of that, because of the recession, because of the dot-com bust that followed the dot-com boom. Then we started with the wars that followed 9/11 - Afghanistan, Iraq. They dragged on for years. They were put largely off budget. They were not paid for. We expanded Medicare to include prescription drugs for seniors. That was not paid for. That was put off budget.", "And so we passed a period of time in which that budget responsibility of the 1990s turned into a, well, turned into a circus, essentially of revenue decreases and expenditure increases that brought us back into the soup we're in today, with the cherry on top, of course, being the 2008 recession, the crash in the financial markets, the toxic asset recovery program that cost a lot of money, at least temporarily, then the stimulus, which cost a lot of money and that's all out the door - with those wars still continuing and with the revenues still depressed because of the post-2008 recession.", "Right, which obviously means we don't have the runaway economy we had in the mid-'90s, but we do have a similarly divided government. What has the Republican response been?", "Well, most recently the Republican response, driven largely by the politics of 2010, has been horror-stricken by the new levels of the federal budget deficit. Now, we saw hundreds of billions of dollars a year in budget deficits in the 1980s and in the early 1990s. That got under control, as I was saying a moment ago. Now that the deficit problem is back, it's back with a vengeance. And since 2008, with all those factors that I totaled up over that whole bad decade - since 2008 it has exploded to this trillion, trillion and a half level of deficit. And that has a lot of people in the country in shock and was largely responsibly - not solely, but largely responsible - for the rise of the Tea Party.", "The new Republicans in Congress are highly responsive to the Tea Party, even the ones who aren't members of the Tea Party Caucus. Ones who have been there for decades are still highly responsive to those politics. They're worried about their own primaries coming up and they want to be responsive to the Tea Party on this question of cutting the deficit. So in the House, where they do have a majority, the Republicans are trying to cut a hundred billion dollars immediately from currently obligated spending for the current year 2011.", "And what are some of the targets on that list?", "Well, it's across the board discretionary world. In fact, they've even begun to extend it into security functions, not the military so much, but into homeland security, a billion dollar cut there. And cutting all kinds of social programs, community development grants - of course those are cut to some degree, lesser degree, in the president's budget as well. And any place where the number is not already fixed by something like Social Security promises or Medicare promises, the Republicans are looking to cut back in every kind of service area that the federal government participates in.", "And I should mention that Neal Conan will host a more detailed conversation about exactly what is in the budget and - well, answer some more in-depth, detailed questions about what is likely to be on the chopping block, coming up on another episode.", "Let's hear from Shawn in Rochester, Michigan. Shawn, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.", "How are you doing? Nice to speak with you.", "Welcome to the program.", "Thank you. I - my question is this: Where does this begin, as far as the federal government getting the authority to promise all this money. You know, I think if the federal government had their way, they'd like to participate in everything. But, you know, back in the Civil War, Andrew Jackson was very, very much against the federal government then and their ability to participate or put themselves in the middle of a lot of these things. So (unintelligible) to reiterate my question - that is, where does the federal government get the authority to come in and make these promises as far as create this budget deficit and then leave it to somebody else to clean up?", "Shawn, thanks for your call. Ron Elving?", "Well, the federal government took on these obligations willingly, of its own accord, a long time ago, really. The Social Security began in 1935 and Medicare, which has greatly expanded the costs of caring for our senior population, came in in 1965, which is getting to be quite a long time ago as well. It is in recent years, as people have lived longer and as inflation has driven up the costs of both Social Security and especially medical care, that programs that at first seemed relatively modest and manageable when Congress passed them in 1935, in 1965, have in our time exploded in cost and will be even more explosively costly in the 10, 15, 20, 25 years to come. That's what's happened.", "It's a congressionally accepted responsibility supported by FDR in the '30s, LBJ in the 1960s. Those programs were popular and remain enormously popular today. People don't want to see them cut. And yet those are the programs with the costs, along with defense, Medicaid and a few other things, that are driving this deficit.", "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. We have an email from Craig in Redwood City. He says: What's the current talk about the Republicans not raising the debt ceiling? And what are the odds of the USA defaulting on the national debt? And would there be a good side of doing that?", "Those are three great questions. The talk about raising the national debt ceiling, which happens periodically as we reach the...", "Quickly define what we're talking about there.", "Well, the federal government has, as I was saying earlier, trillions of dollars in obligations outstanding, and they've come due periodically, five-year, 10-year, 30-year, and so forth. And these various obligations have to be paid at the time they come due. And new obligations are always being issued, as I say, as the deficit and the  as the deficit continues each year and adds to the previous debt, this pile of debt gets higher and has to be refinanced.", "As it's refinanced, it - at a higher level, we have to go back to Congress -that is to say the administration, whoever it is, Republican or Democratic, must come back to the Congress and say give us a higher debt limit than you gave us last time you authorized us to borrow this much money. It's an ugly vote, usually. Whoever is in the majority in the Congress is more or less obligated to do it, because the United States does not want to default on its obligations. That would have enormous global implications as far as the worldwide financial system, if the most reliable country with the most reliable debt obligations were to default. Don't even want to think about it. So it's probably just talk to say that we would not raise the debt ceiling.", "But if we were not to raise the debt ceiling, either the government would have to stop spending money or we would have to default on some of those obligations coming due. Now, there are lots of little wiggle arguments here. We could do this. We could do that. We could push it off for a certain number of months. It might not happen on a day certain. But basically, if we don't borrow more money and we keep spending money without taking in enough money to pay for it, something's got to give.", "Let's hear from Art in The Villages in Florida. Art, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.", "Thank you very much. I appreciate you having me on today. I have a comment, and then I have a question, if you will, for me, please. I can't quite understand how we could ever even consider pulling funding from our most vulnerable people, such as people in the mental health clinics, people in the heating assistance programs. I can't - I don't think that's conscionable for us to even consider doing something like that, to put people on the streets or have them freeze to death.", "The other question I have, though - and I'm not an economist - but with the deficits that we have and the tax relief that we're offering to our citizenry these days, how on Earth are we ever going to make any money or be able to pay these debts off if we don't increase taxes? I hear no talks about increasing taxes, and obviously we have to do that, especially with the unemployment rate as it is today. I'll hang up and listen to - online - offline. Thank you.", "Thank you, Art.", "This is the essential philosophical argument that we have between, if you will, people who are seen as fiscal liberals and fiscal conservatives. Fiscal liberals think we should raise more revenue by taxing those who have the most money in order to provide the services that we have historically provided to the underprivileged, to the poor, to people who might not be able to heat their homes, and to a wide variety of other worthy programs most people would say the federal government ought to do. At the same time, there is the fiscal conservative philosophy that says we are living beyond our means in that we are now taxing with the states and the local governments and the federal government more than a fifth of the total value of the economy away, and that when it gets that high in our economy or possibly in other capitalistic economies in the Western world, there starts to be a pushback, a pushback in terms of people evading taxes, taxes become less efficient, it gets more difficult to actually see the benefit of each tax increase, actually, in terms of producing revenue. So we get into arguments there of an economic nature but also of a philosophic nature. How much should the people who have give up for the people who have not? That is a philosophical, perhaps even a moral argument, for a great number of people.", "And we should just mention quickly that this is the first day of this budget, that a lot of things get reinstated, a lot of things get added to the cut list. It's a long process.", "Indeed. And perhaps one would have to say that these moments when it gets in the news, because the president drops his budget to the House votes for something or the Senate then votes for something, and they have a conference and it goes back and forth and on and on, there's a certain amount of kabuki theater to a lot of it too, before we get down to the actual numbers that are really written into law.", "NPR's senior Washington editor, Ron Elving, joined us here in studio 3A.

To consider, they would add it to it, I suppose, if he says something remarkable this afternoon. But they seemed to feel that they have enough evidence to move forward with the impeachment.

On Wednesday, in a surprise move, Graf pleaded guilty while the jury was still in deliberations, apparently deadlocked on the question of his guilt or innocence.", "utt": ["The story of Ed Graf of Hewitt, Texas, near Waco is a real-life forensics thriller full of plot twists that would be hard to believe even in a fictional TV-crime-lab procedural.", "First, Graf was convicted of the arson deaths of his two young stepsons in 1986. He was sentenced to life in prison. And for 28 years, he protested his innocence. His conviction was based on expert testimony about arson that is now considered junk science.", "Last year, the Texas Court of Appeals agreed he'd been convicted on the basis of false expert testimony. They ruled and he deserved a new trial. Well, that trial ended this week in stunning fashion. With the jury out deliberating, Ed Graf changed his plea to guilty. Dave Mann of the Texas Observer has followed this story from its earliest days. Welcome.", "Thank you.", "Graf's first conviction was based at least in part on forensic evidence about arson that came under attack as specious. Now, after a trial I gather without forensic evidence, he pleaded guilty. Does that mean that way back then justice was served albeit very sloppily?", "Not necessarily. I think at first when he pled guilty earlier this week, a lot of people were surprised. And as the details of his plea agreement emerged, it began to make more sense. His plea agreement stipulates that he'll get a six 60-year sentence. And under those stipulations - under some quirks of Texas law - that would make him eligible for parole. And he'll actually be able to get out in few months. So essentially Ed Graf kind of gave up his quest for innocence and pled guilty for the opportunity to get out of prison in a few months.", "He's doing that at a time when the jury had been reported to be deadlocked. Do we have any idea where they were headed?", "Well, the evidence indicates that they were headed for a guilty verdict. They'd initially indicated after their first few hours of deliberations that they were 10 votes for guilty and two votes for not guilty. And as the deliberations went on, the prospect of a hung jury became more likely and the two sides began negotiating a plea agreement. And just as they finished that plea deal, the jury reached a verdict. And in fact, as they were finalizing the plea agreement, the bailiff was entering the courtroom with a note saying the jury had reached a guilty verdict.", "Of course, that verdict was never delivered because of the deal that had happened. This was the very same jury that I gather had sent a question to the judge - how many jurors would have to vote for a verdict to make it unanimous?", "Yeah, in a - in what's been a very emotional and very serious saga and a very emotional trial, that was one of the lighter moments. One of their first questions to the judge was how many votes does it take for us to be unanimous. And he informed them that all 12 had to concur with the opinion.", "This was a trial about two things - on the one hand, the guilt or innocence of Ed Graf and the other the validity of the kind of evidence that was used to convict him the first time - arson evidence. His - his story notwithstanding, there's been something of a revolution in how that evidence is viewed nowadays.", "Yeah, the Ed Graf case is really part of a complete overhaul in how we view fire investigations and fire science. Just about everything that fire investigators once believed were indicators of arson have now been shown to be unreliable. And many of the burn patterns and other indicators that fire investigators used for decades to convict people of arson have shown to essentially be junk science.", "We have a much better understanding of how fire behaves now. And arson cases are prosecuted under, you know, what is now probably true science. And that science would lead the experts to believe that the fire in the Ed Graf case was in fact accidental. And that's what some nationally-known experts testified to over the past two weeks.", "Ed Graf's case was championed by the Texas Innocence Project. What did they say about him suddenly pleading guilty?", "Well, I think there's a little bit of confusion because the director of the Texas Innocence Project was quoted in the Waco paper kind of saying well, the most important thing here is the science and not whether each individual person is guilty or innocent. The most important thing is that we reexamine the science and that the proper fire science was offered in the courtroom, no matter what the verdict is.", "So I think there was a little bit of hedging there. The reality is that Ed Graf is going to get out of prison because of the quirk in Texas parole law. But I think that the fact he got up in court and admitted guilt definitely rattled some people who for a long time had believed in his innocence.", "Dave Mann, thanks for talking us today.", "My pleasure.", "Dave Mann is the editor of the Texas Observer."], "speaker": ["ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST", "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST", "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST", "DAVE MANN", "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST", "DAVE MANN", "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST", "DAVE MANN", "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST", "DAVE MANN", "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST", "DAVE MANN", "DAVE MANN", "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST", "DAVE MANN", "DAVE MANN", "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST", "DAVE MANN", "ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST"], "snorkel_label": [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]}

Robert Siegel talks about the poll results with Michael Dimock, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, to make sense of what the results might mean.", "utt": ["Americans see U.S. power in the world declining. That is the key finding of a survey by the Pew Research Center. It also finds that most Americans think the U.S. should be engaged in the global economy, but ought to concentrate on solving domestic problems. Michael Dimock is here to talk about this poll. He's the director of the Pew Research Center. Good to see you again.", "Hi, Robert.", "And first, how many Americans say the U.S. role is declining and how significant a number is that?", "Well, it's 53 percent, so just over half feel like America is less important and powerful in the world than it was 10 years ago. That's the highest we've seen in over 40 years on this question, a real sense that America's role is less powerful and the respect for the U.S. has declined as well.", "Now, 10 years ago, the U.S. was the leader of a multinational assault on al-Qaida and just getting into a war with Iraq. Is one message here, please, no more Iraqs, take care of things at home?", "Yes, definitely. There's a corollary with this, is a sense of hesitance among the American public, at least, if not resistance, to foreign engagements, both military and even diplomatic or other roles the U.S. can play geopolitically, a sense from the public that we should be focusing on the issues at home, both economic and political, more so than engaging with the rest of the world.", "But you note, people draw a distinction between global leadership and participation in the world economy. You said that this means we're not seeing evidence of a broad isolationism among Americans.", "Absolutely. Isolationism is far too strong of a word and too blunt of a word for where the American public stands right now because they see much more opportunity than risk when it comes to economic engagement. They think that participating in the economy is going to bring more good to the U.S. It'll grow our economy.", "The highest numbers we've seen, in terms of support for international trade and closer ties between businesses in the U.S. and elsewhere, a real sense that the way we get out of this economic problem is not through retraction or protectionism, but engagement.", "But people have very different views in this survey of foreign companies coming to the U.S. and presumably hiring Americans and American companies going abroad and outsourcing jobs.", "That's right. That's right. I mean engaging economically is not without risks, to be sure, and jobs are a high concern for Americans. One of the highest foreign policy priorities they have is protecting American jobs. And they do see U.S. companies setting up operations overseas as problematic because it does potentially risk U.S. jobs.", "Place this poll in time with respect to U.S. moves with regard to Syria and Iran recently.", "Yeah. I mean Syria was a real nadir for Barack Obama's foreign policy. He came into office with actually very strong public support for his foreign policy agenda. Syria has been a real problem. It was a sense of weak leadership, a sense that it's really damaged America's role. From the public's perspective, there was never any interest in active military engagement, and once that was on the table, the public got very hesitant to get involved with Syria.", "But even though that was averted in the end, the public looks back on that event in a very negative light.", "And Iran?", "Iran continues to be seen as a big threat. People are concerned about Iran's nuclear program, but diplomacy is far preferable to other approaches that could be taken here, and while people may not be terribly optimistic that we're going to solve the issue within the next few months, they do want to support these engagements.", "One basic message here, though, for somebody who would be facing the public on foreign policy is anti-interventionism is a strong stream in American thought right now.", "It really is. Any way that the U.S. is trying to inject itself into the affairs of other parts of the world are viewed with a lot of skepticism right now and it reflects not just war fatigue, but there's a broad sense among the American public right now that our efforts to affect policy in other parts of the world often either do little good or in fact may do more harm than good.

But in the city's largest school district, the last traditional public schools have closed their doors permanently, making this the first all-charter district in the country. This transition started after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the city in 2005.", "At the time, most of the public schools were absorbed into the recovery school district. Gradually, those public schools have turned into public charters.", "Sarah Carr covers education in New Orleans for the Hechinger Report. We asked her how public charters are different than the public schools they replaced.", "Basically, the principals have a lot more independence and autonomy to run the schools as they see fit. They really have carte blanche to hire and to fire and decide with the curriculum will be and how the money will be spent. So in a lot of ways, they're sort of public-private hybrids, in that they're publicly funded, but they're somewhat more privately run.", "And the idea is also to have sort of a choice landscape where parents can pick from this array of charter schools. And that's where - I think, that there is still a ways to go, in terms of empowering low income families, in particular, to really be able to navigate this new landscape well.", "What do you mean by that? Where are families getting lost in the system?", "It's much better than it was five or six years ago. Then, you might have had, you know, 50 different application and admission processes across the schools. And that really favored the families with the time, with the transportation, with the means, with the connections to navigate those different admissions processes. They do now have a common application process that nearly all of the schools participate in. And I think that has leveled the playing field, to some extent.", "But I think you've seen this cycle of sort of schools opening and closing when they don't meet tests score bars. And I think it's, oftentimes, the most vulnerable families that are sort of shuffled from one school that's closing to another that's going to close and don't really have stability, in terms of schooling at this point in the city.", "So if this change likely to bring more stability to this district?", "That remains to be seen. I think the theory is that it is going to be a very Darwinian type of structure, where the strong schools survive and the weaker ones are closed down. And I definitely would not want to see schools that don't serve children well staying open in the long run.", "But there also has to be attention paid to - if you're going to close a school, is there a better option that we can send those kids to? And are we really giving the families the tools that they need to make the best decisions for their kids?", "Is there a way to measure whether or not students are thriving? Are they performing better in charter schools?", "Overall, the test scores have gone up considerably. Before Katrina, there were less than half of the city's public school students who were meeting the basic level on the state's standardized tests. And now you have close to two-thirds meeting that level.", "But I really think we need to watch what happens moving forward, because a lot of the charter schools are still pretty young and are graduating their first students. And whether or not they're producing students who are going to go on and thrive in college remains to be seen.", "And Sarah, I understand you've been talking to students about how this transition in this particular district has affected them. Could you share with us a little bit about what they had to say? What perhaps surprised you when you had these conversations?", "Sure. One of the things that was surprising to me was just the diversity of viewpoints. I mean, you had one student arguing that Teach for America has really been fundamental to the success of the schools post-Katrina. And you had another who was lamenting the firing of thousands of veteran black educators and who was saying that a lot of the young white teachers who come to the city are unable to connect with students.", "Sarah Carr is an education reporter for the Hechinger Report.

These children are      meant to be studying the Koran, but most of the barefoot boys with runny      noses and dirty, ragged clothes are not learning the Muslim holy book.      The Talibae spend long days trudging up and down the streets of Senegal's      cities with their hands outstretched as they approach you for a little      money with a whispered prayer. Begging for a coin or two, they say the      collections are for their marabu(ph), their teachers.", "Unidentified Boy #1:  (Foreign language spoken)", "These boys say they've come from far, all the way across      the border from Guinea-Bissau and neighboring Mali to Senegal.  For some      unscrupulous adults, the Talibae make excellent business sense.  Some of      the boys say they get beaten if they don't deliver a daily quota,      sometimes as much as a dollar, and that's a princely sum in Senegal.  But      when asked to recite the Koran, they can barely do so.", "Unidentified Boy #2:  (Foreign language spoken)", "Ian Hopwood is the head of the United Nations children's      agency UNICEF in Senegal.

It's a problem the Senegalese      government does not publicize.  But journalist and commentator Amadu      Ticanci(ph) says just about everyone is talking about the Talibae.", "It was accepted in traditional societies      that these boys who are learning go to beg but--just to infuse humility,      but it has been corrupted, deeply corrupted by the urban societies,      transformed in the way that some teachers have now found wealth.  I think      the number of beggars in the streets gives a bad impression, but it also      shows the poverty.  It's not only the Talibae factor, but it's a general      picture of how far poverty has taken root in this country.", "About an hour's drive east of the Senegalese capital, 20      young boys are studiously reciting the Koran from their wooden handheld      blackboards in a sandy-floored classroom.

Instead of standing during the national anthem before games, he would kneel. This sparked outrage among those who said he was being unpatriotic. He also had a lot of supporters, and now those supporters allege that NFL owners are freezing him out because of his political beliefs.", "NPR's sports correspondent Tom Goldman joins us to talk more about this controversy. Hey there, Tom.", "Hi Audie.", "So is there any way to prove this idea of collusion to keep Kaepernick out?", "It's very hard to prove, Audie - no evidence of backroom deals being made. But it doesn't look good as one quarterback after another gets signed and it's not Colin Kaepernick. Jay Cutler this week signed with Miami, coming out of retirement and basically having to be talked into playing again. Baltimore signed a quarterback without NFL experience, a guy who played most recently in the Arena Football League. Now, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said last week, no collusion. Although it is safe to say there are NFL owners who worry about signing Kaepernick and the message that would send.", "Now, before we get to that, I want to ask about Kaepernick's abilities on the field. I mean how does he compare to these other quarterbacks?", "Excellent question. He led San Francisco to one Super Bowl following the 2012 season and to two conference championships. Of course that's ancient history to teams that want to win now. A more important stat is last year. On arguably the worst team in the NFL, the San Francisco 49ers, Kaepernick threw 16 touchdown passes and had only four interceptions in 11 starts. So he showed he can still play. And when you consider there are 32 starters, 32 backups, 32 emergency quarterbacks who carry clipboards during games and Colin Kaepernick isn't on a roster, it's questionable.", "The other thing that his defenders note is that when you look back at the controversies the NFL has had over the last couple of years, there are players who have done a lot worse than kneeling during the national anthem, and they're still playing.", "Yeah, players who have committed domestic violence, rape, vehicular homicide. They've been busted for drugs and brutal dogfighting. We remember that. You know, there are people, though, who consider what Colin Kaepernick did beyond the pale, taking a knee during the National Anthem, which really took on a life of its own. He says he was protesting overall treatment of people in black communities during a time of great tensions following shootings by police of African-Americans. Kaepernick said early on he was not against the military but wanted to help motivate social change. But for many fans, it was interpreted as un-American, unpatriotic. And some owners worry about that.", "What is the NFL saying about all this?", "Well, as I mentioned Roger Goodell denies collusion. He said recently that teams make decisions based on what's in the best interest of their team, and they make these decisions individually. I talked to Dr. Harry Edwards today. He's the well-known sociologist who's really been at the intersection of sport and politics and activism for 50 years. He thinks the NFL needs to get out in front while it can.

The most recent data I've been able to look at is in 2010, because I'm using different data sets. By 2010, disapproval has become localized, where now it's just found among Southerners, Evangelical Protestants, Republicans and African-Americans - predominately.", "And is this a true tipping point?", "It may be. It seems like it. The trends in attitude change really picked up in 2008. Since 2008 we've seen much faster movement towards approval on this issue.", "Let's see if we can get another caller in on the conversation, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Call and tell us how the conversation changed when someone came out around your dinner table or at your workplace, 800-989-8255. And let's start with Catherine(ph), Catherine with us from Norman, Oklahoma.", "Hello.", "Hi.", "Thank you for taking my call.", "Go ahead, please.", "My daughter is 15, and she came out when she was 12, and we were quite supportive. She had a lot of heartache, though, at her middle school; and it was not from her students, it was from her teachers. And she silently chose to not say the Pledge of Allegiance, and she got in the car one day and told me: I'm not standing for the pledge until there's liberty and justice for all and until I can marry whomever I want.", "And it kind of started from there, but the school was harsh, and she then made some shoes that are beautiful, that they wanted to suspend her from school because she wrote on the shoes equality, love and love, and fag. And that's what started it all for her. It was very harsh, and she had teachers that were very unkind to her throughout her seventh grade year.", "And was this some time ago?", "Four years ago. She's now in 10th grade. She's a sophomore at her high school. She's class president. Her peers accept everything about her, but the adults - not her family, but the academics in her life - were where it was very hard.", "But we live in the South, we live in Oklahoma, and it's hard at school. Some days she feels frightened, because, just as your sociologist was talking about a minute ago, living in Oklahoma some days it is really hard and not accepted, and it's frightening sometimes.", "And you said the adults in her family were accepting right from the beginning?", "Absolutely. My goodness. We were - as her mother, I was telling your person earlier, I thought well, so what were you waiting for? Because mothers seem to know a lot, we think, anyway.", "But my daughter has explained to me over and over it's no one's story to tell but that individual, please respect that. And that is something that I have learned through the years. And she's brave, she's smart, she's articulate, and I think the world of her. And I think she has a great future ahead, but sometimes a long future. You know, some people are not very kind at all.", "Well, Catherine, thank you very much. We wish you and your daughter the best.", "Thank you so much for taking my call.", "Sure. And Michelle Baunach, as we listen to that story, one of the sharpest divides along public opinion on this question is generational.", "True, it is. The 18- to 29-year-old age group is overwhelmingly approving of gay marriage. However, again, in the research that I conducted, we found that the trend over time, from 1988 to 2010, was due mostly to people changing their minds on the subject, that two-thirds of the overall societal level of change was because individuals had changed their mind - either because they'd gotten to know people, or they're influenced by media, or they'd just gotten to know more about the topic.", "But most of the change in this attitude is because individuals have changed their mind. And not simply because that older, supposedly less tolerant individuals, have been replaced by younger, supposedly, more tolerant individuals.", "We read that changing your mind is difficult to do and more difficult to accomplish.", "But it's happened quite a bit on this topic. It's really quite fascinating, to be honest. This is a topic that I wouldn't have predicted before I went into this that the majority change would have been due to changing their minds. I would have thought, along with a lot of other people, that it would have due to generational changes.", "And while that does have an impact, it's that more and more it's because people are getting to know others, or they're just getting to know more about it, and they are changing their minds on the issue. And we see this with all the prominent politicians that have come out recently on this topic. We see this every day that people are saying, well, gee, once I got to know so-and-so, or once I had a gay son or a lesbian daughter or once I just thought more about it I changed my views.", "And thought more about it. Some people say wait a minute, if I see this as an issue of individual rights, of civil rights, suddenly it looks different.", "It does, and that's part of the success of the gay rights movement is that the gay rights movement has been able to frame this issue in terms of a civil right, and when people start thinking about it that way, when they don't think about it on a moral issue, but they think about it on an equality issue, a civil rights issue, they tend to agree with this topic.", "And where do you see this going?", "You know, it's hard to predict, but it seems that if the current trends continue that we'll have just greater support overall. We're now, like you mentioned, previously were about 48 percent according to the Pew poll. That'll probably continue to increase. There are some gay rights issues that regularly pull in the high 80 to 90 percent, such as employment discrimination protection.", "Those kind of issues or, you know, serving in the military tend to get even wider support. This issue may approach that level of support at some point. I doubt that we'll ever get to 100 percent, we rarely get to 100 percent on any type of attitude. There will always be some people for whom this is a topic they will disapprove or something that they disapprove of.", "But if current trends continue, we'll see even wide approval.", "Our guest is Michelle Baunach, we're talking about what changes when someone comes out of the closet.

It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.", "This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan. We're talking about how support for gay marriage has shifted as more people see relatives, friends, co-workers come out of the closet. Chief Justice John Roberts' cousin and her partner will be in the audience for the Supreme Court's hearings on California's Proposition 8 and the Defense of Marriage Act when those arguments start here in Washington, D.C., tomorrow. No idea what influence, if any, that might have on the chief justice.", "We're asking you how did someone you know coming out change the conversation around your dinner table or at your workplace, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. That's at npr.org. And click on TALK OF THE NATION.", "Our guest is Michelle Baunach, professor of sociology at Georgia State University, speaking with us from her office in Atlanta. Let's get another caller in, and this is Kyle(ph) and Kyle on the line with us from St. Louis.", "Hey, thanks for taking the call.", "Sure, go ahead.", "When I was a younger guy, I grew up in the rural South, actually in Georgia. And, you know, it was kind of a community that was a bit homophobic. The homosexual lifestyle was pretty taboo. And, you know, I kind of - I was a bit neutral on the issue at the time. I didn't really know whether I felt good or bad about it.", "But when I graduated high school, I took a job at a florist with an older man. At the time, I did know he was homosexual, but he came out to me after a while, after I had been working there for a few months. And he really changed my perspective on the thing, on the issue, and I realized he's just like anyone else, and he's such a nice guy. He was willing to bend over backwards to do whatever he could to help me out if I needed it, such a fantastic person.", "And it just kind of - it really changed not just my perspective on the issue but also, you know, really making me regret all those times when I was a younger man not having stood up for someone and not having said at least a little bit more than I did and just kind of sitting silently by as people were teased and made fun of, and, you know, especially rumors ran rampant at that point once I took that job and just to get a small taste of what it's like to live in a town where that is such a taboo and to be associated with a community of people that are just kind of shunned. It was...", "Just because you were working at a florist shop, everybody assumed you were gay.", "Well, it actually turned out - I found out a little bit later that he had a bit of a reputation around town as a homosexual. I mean, he was a well-known homosexual. I just, you know, I was blind to the idea.", "And so as this - did you have a conversation with him, I wonder?", "Yeah absolutely. He just - you know, I think after a while he felt it was the right thing to do to just let me know, just in case. Maybe he was wondering how I felt about it and didn't know if it would be comfortable to be working with somebody who had a problem with his homosexuality or not.", "And, you know, of course I didn't because it just really opened my eyes to this idea. I don't know what I was thinking before, that they were like green-eyed monsters or something, but...", "You know, he really let me know that he is just like anyone else, and being a homosexual man makes no difference on the type of person that you are. And, you know, he can be just as great and just as fun to be around as anyone else. So it really opened my eyes to the point now where I have a lesbian roommate. I have many, many gay friends, and it's just - it's really opened my eyes to a community of people that are just a lot of fun to be around.", "OK, thanks very much Kyle.", "Thank you, go Dogs.", "OK. Here's an email that we have from Teresa(ph): I would be a hypocrite if I changed my opinion of gay marriage just because my daughter or son were gay. I love my gay friends, and I show them my love and friendship without changing my core beliefs. And Michelle Baunach, as you look at the numbers, obviously there are any number of people who agree with Teresa and are not going to change their beliefs no matter what.", "True, there are still some people who are going to disapprove of it because it may violate some core belief of theirs. It may be very important to their political identity as a conservative, or it may be very important to them in a religious identity, if they're an evangelical protestant, or if they belong to another group, another religious affiliation that disapproves of gay marriage. They may never approve of it.", "Let's - here's another email, this is from Catherine(ph): I'm 28 years old and was raised in a very conservative family. My best friend since childhood came out to me when we were in high school, and it fundamentally changed my view of gay and lesbian people.", "Since college, I have met several people in the gay community and have come to embrace marriage equality as a crucial part of equal treatment for all people. What surprised me was when I was able to convince my mom that equality is important. I simply told her to think about my friend, whom she's known our whole lives. If my friend, who lives in New Zealand, gets a marriage there, she can never come home because her spouse will not have the same immigration rights. Now my mom supports gay marriage, as well.", "Let's go to Gregory(ph), and Gregory's on the line with us from Houston.", "Hello, I'm glad to be on.", "Go ahead, please.", "I'm African-American, Southern Baptist. I grew up in Mississippi. And gay - the whole gay issue has never been a topic that we really talked about. We didn't really think about it because nobody close to us was gay. But my brother, about two years ago, came out. And it really had an effect on us. He most recently committed suicide, and we don't believe it was necessarily because he was gay.", "But since he came out and since his suicide, we've completely done a 360. We actually changed churches because we felt like our pastor was - he demonized the issue a bit too much. And we completely changed our view about gay rights and the whole gay issue altogether.", "Gregory, did you say suicide?", "Yes, yes, but we don't think it was necessarily because of - because he was gay. We think it was because of something entirely different.", "And then what happened when you changed churches?", "We just went to a nondenominational church, a church that doesn't really talk about the whole gay issue, you know.", "And so they still don't talk about it, but they don't demonize it, either.", "Exactly, exactly. It was just too much to handle, you know?", "I can understand that. I can understand that. Thanks, Gregory, very much for the phone call.", "Thank you.", "And Michelle Baunach, is there any way go gauge how much taboo plays in this discussion?", "I don't think there is. There - excuse me, I'm sorry. There is a lot of taboo, especially among certain groups and especially when they hear it from leaders in their organization like some churches or some political parties. There is a lot of negative feeling towards this.", "However, that negative feeling has been dissipating. It has been going away. We can look at other survey data, not specifically on same-sex marriage, but we can look at a question that asks people about what they think the morality of homosexuality is. And people think - seeing homosexuality as being immoral has also gone way down, that more and more people see homosexuality as a gay rights issue, like we talked about previously, but also not as a morality issue. They just see it as maybe a to-each-his-own kind of perspective.", "And I wanted to ask you about precedent. There will be discussion tomorrow when the Supreme Court listens to this case, and of course the day after on the Defense of Marriage Act case, about the precedent of the Loving decision, where there were still a lot of states in the Union that had barred miscegenation, that's cross-race marriage, and of course the Supreme Court, what, 50, 60 years ago struck that down in the Loving case out of Virginia. Is there any polling on how attitudes changed as a result of that, or was your profession in - not taking those kind of polls at that time?", "There were some polls. The ones I looked at recently, because this topic has been coming up a lot lately, went back to 1972. But I know I have read about the history of that case, about the Loving versus Virginia Supreme Court case. There were still national-level polls that were showing majority disapproval of getting rid of those types of laws at the time that the case was decided in the early '60s.", "Since then, attitudes have become much more favorable towards interracial marriage. In fact the last data that I could find on this source that we tend to use as sociologists called the General Social Survey, they last asked the question in 2002. They don't even ask it anymore because there is so much general support for interracial marriage or at least disapproval of a law against interracial marriage, that in 2002, less than 10 percent of the people polled thought that there should still be a law against interracial marriage.", "Well, Michelle Baunach, thank you very much for your time. We know you've got another appointment, and we'll thank you very much and let you go.", "Thank you very much, Neal, this is a lot of fun.", "Michelle Baunach, a professor at the Department of Sociology at Georgia State University, with us from her office in Atlanta. Here's an email from Autumn(ph): In my case it wasn't a family member, it was a classmate in magazine article writing class at a church-sponsored university. We had been asked to write an article expressing a church doctrine and then we had to pass them around and let other students read them. The one I got was from a young man and his experience learning about his own sexuality. I suppose that ever since then, I have been more open to non-normal social characteristics.", "Not sure what normal qualifies in that - qualifies as in that regard, but let's get Bob(ph) on the line, Bob with us from Nashville.", "Hi, thanks for taking my call.", "Go ahead, please.", "I - my perspective on this issue is that my father came out to my family and caused my parents to get a divorce in 1982, I think. And I lived at the time in the rural Northwest. And I was so - and I grew up and went to a very small school. And I was immediately - my immediate fear was about the response my classmates - at the time, I was in seventh grade.", "And then after my parents got divorced, my mom took us to her ancestral home, which was the rural south, and it was the same thing. I was very uncomfortable with the idea of telling even close friends about it for fear of what kind of response it might engender not on those - not from those people, but from other people.", "Yeah.", "And it just is sort - that sort of has evolved over time. You know, as time has marched on, it's become less an issue, but it was really quite - I remember being pretty fearful of that time.", "I could understand that, and I can - also, I wanted to ask, kids can be very angry with the parents that they might hold responsible for breaking up the marriage, and the can play a part too.", "That's true. Yeah, it just - at the time, I mean, the AIDS crisis was, you know, full-blown and then the media everywhere. And there were just lots and lots of ways for people to - and I tended to be picked on anyway, so, you know, [laugh] it's just - it was, at a sense, you know, from whatever self-defense just not to talk about it.", "But, you know, over time, I think it's really has more to do with the climate of the country and the general - as it has been described on your program - the general, you know, increase in acceptance of the life of the sexual orientation.", "And how are...", "(Unintelligible) in me, but...", "Yeah. How are things with your dad now?", "My dad and I, we're okay. We - as far as his relationship in this matter concerned, I mean, I'm very respectful and it's - we don't - we actually - he lives abroad, so I don't see him that often. But when I do, it's, you know, that's not an issue at all.", "Well, thanks very much for the call and we're glad things - obviously, it took some time, but we're glad things worked out.", "Thank you.", "Here's an email from Emily. \"In 1994, I went around Idaho and campaigned for Prop 1 with my uncle, Kelly Walton. Prop 1 failed, but it would've prevented homosexuals from receiving minority status in Idaho. My mind was changed when I had a co-worker reveal to the company we worked for that she was gay. She has a partner and two children, and I realized the pressure she was always under to be a perfect employee so that she wouldn't get fired for being gay.\"", "\"I'm glad my boss didn't fire her. And last year, I volunteered with Add the Words, Idaho to increase protection to my gay friends and neighbors there in the state of Idaho.\" We're talking about how coming out has changed the conversation about gay marriage and other issues. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Darren is on the line with us from Sacramento.", "Hello, Neal.", "Hi, Darren. Go ahead, please.", "Well, as I talked to your screener, I talked about I'm a local politician and in a very conservative part of California, if you can imagine that, in the foothill areas, more rural areas. And this is a question that's come up to, you know, in my election processes. And what I had to explain to people is that, what do we hope to gain on either side of the issue?", "My best friend that I've had since I was 12 years old, and I was the best man at his wedding, when he married a woman, in the Mormon temple the less, in Oakland, came out and is now living with his partner in Los Angeles. He's been out for about 10 years now. My sister, most recently, who is also married in the Mormon temple, came out and is now living with her wife in Albuquerque in Mexico.", "So these things have an ability to change one's perspective in terms of not necessarily the morality of issue, but if you could put that aside and just the humanitarian aspect of it, and what is it that our government hopes to accomplish by granting or denying the rights of marriage?", "And clearly, the community includes any number of Mormons, as the Mormons were seen as one of the big proponents of Prop 8 there in California.", "Sure, absolutely. And so that's something that also weighs heavily with me. You know, the pressure that I felt, you know, since a young man, to be on the side of the morality aspect of the argument. However, if you're looking at simply from the perspective of a civil rights issue, which you mentioned earlier in the show, there was gentleman that came out a few years ago, in flip side, I believe he works for the Cato Institute or something like that.", "And he is the one that helped pushed, at least here in California, the concept of a civil rights issue. And he changed lives and actually open to promote the Marriage Act (unintelligible). Now...", "The Cato Institute is the think tank of the Libertarian Party.", "Correct. So at that point, you know, with all these things mounted in my mind, I had to come to my own conclusion on this. And what I came to is that, what is it that the government hopes to accomplish with the issue of marriage license? This is so that we can see, you know, who are legally bound to each other in terms of if there's a divorce proceeding, if there's a death, those types of things.", "How the courts are going to handle the disbursement of a state, or those type of things like that. And in that particular instance, I mean, it doesn't really matter. The idea of being married or not married in the eyes of the government is simply a transactional issue that has to deal with financial matters, you know, for the most part, as far as I can tell.", "All right. Well, thanks very much.", "You're welcome.", "And here is an email that we have. This is from Tom. \"Listening from the car as my wife drives, I was a pre \"don't ask, don't tell\" army officer. My army roommate came out after we got out of the army. He was my best friend but couldn't tell me he was gay. I came from a small town, attended a catholic university, my friend's coming out was a life-changing experience. It made me look at any biases I might have and examine my conscience. My friend always had my back but was afraid to tell me who he was. And we'll end with this email from Miriam, a straight and strong supporter of gay marriage. She writes: I'm 68. My change in attitude took place in the 1970s when I was part of a women's group that included several sisters struggling with their sexual preferences. By the time these women realize they were lesbians, we had all become deeply involved in knowing and supporting one another. After one of these women, afraid of who she was in family and societal reaction, attempted to commit suicide. I visited her in the hospital, said nothing and just held her hand as tightly as I could. It felt like I was trying to pull her back from the cliff. After she recovered, she told me felt that I was really there for here and it helped. We have since lost connection but I hope she's married and happy.", "Thanks to all of you who wrote and emailed and contacted us. We're sorry we couldn't get to all of your stories.

Mayor Michael Brown talks with Lulu Garcia-Navarro about the town's new flood protections.", "utt": ["We're now going to take a look at another flood and what lessons it may have for Houston and other cities facing the possibility of disaster. Twenty years ago, 50,000 residents were evacuated from Grand Forks, N.D., when the red river burst its banks. At the time, it was the largest displacement ever in an American city.", "What followed was a painful process of raising homes, redrawing maps and building flood walls. The town has been well-protected ever since. Michael Brown has been the mayor of Grand Forks since the year 2000. And he joins us now. Good morning.", "Good morning.", "So can you remind us, first, of the devastation your city faced in 1997? Take us back.", "Oh, it was like looking out across the ocean. There was water from as far as you could see both ways. And I think it was over a billion dollars worth of damage to our community and East Grand Forks. Seemed quite hopeless, but our message today is one of hope. And I think FEMA has referred to us as a poster child for flood recovery because of what we've accomplished as a community.", "After the flood, the city decided some homes needed to be removed to make way for key infrastructure. How was that decision made?", "Decision-making - that's the most important thing about recovery is people have to make decisions, and whether they're popular or not, to allow the recovery to occur. So we had to choose places that were in the floodplain that couldn't be rebuilt. And those entry-level homes had to be taken to build the infrastructure for the flood recovery project.", "Your own home was slated to be raised to make way for this new flood system. Is that right?", "Yes. That's why I ran for mayor. I didn't think they needed to. And then in hindsight...", "So you were fighting it?", "Yes. You realize how small you are as a person compared to the community and the needs of that community. So we moved our home to another spot so that the flood recovery process could occur. So it was the right decision to do.", "And I think we have a very interesting book. It's called \"Grand Forks Flood Disaster and Recovery Lessons Learned.\" And we shared those with Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Biloxi, Miss., Bernard Parish, New Orleans. We're happy to share those lessons with anyone.", "Can you explain for people who may not understand, why did they have to move some of the houses?", "Because they were close to the river. And if you're going to build a flood protection project to protect a city - a dike - then those homes have to go on until the infrastructure is solid.", "Can you just give us a little example of some of the other things that were done to mitigate flood damage?", "Well, you have one-stop shops where you have - when a person comes for a building permit or something, you have everything available for them in one office. So they don't have to go from city hall to public works to somewhere else.

Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution and David Brooks of The New York Times. They discuss controversial IRS audits, the release of White House emails on Benghazi talking points and the Justice Department's seizure of AP phone logs.", "utt": ["And there is much to discuss with our weekly political commentators, E.J. Dionne of the Washington Post and David Brooks of the New York Times. Hey, there guys.", "E.J. DIONNE: Good to be with you.", "Hello.", "So we've got this trifecta of controversies this week that came to a head in one way or another. We just heard from Peter Overby about the IRS, but there's also Benghazi. The White House released 100 pages of emails revealing the paper trail of edits to talking points for the attack on the U.S. consulate there. And lastly, Attorney General Eric Holder grilled by lawmakers as well this week over the Justice Department's decision to subpoena phone records from the Associated Press while investigating some national security leaks.", "So the question is actually which of these feels the most scandalous to you and I'll start with you, E.J.", "Well, I think the one that raises the most substantive questions is the IRS. I think the Benghazi scandal increasingly is all smoke and no gun. I mean, we've had word that the emails that caused such a ruckus a week ago were actually not exactly what the emails that were exchanged within the government were. And broadly speaking, what the Obama administration has been saying about those emails is true.", "And the notion that when we should be talking about how do we make our embassies more secure, we're arguing about talking points, is just crazy. And I think that one's going to fade. I think the press one is very serious. I'm not sure it's a scandal in the sense that it involves President Obama and it apparently doesn't involve Attorney General Holder because he's recused himself.", "Well, let me come back to you for a minute there because I want to let David jump in at least with his ranking of which of these feels the most scandalous to you.", "I got to start with the Holder one or the Justice Department attack. That seems to be the most upfront, the most obvious and the most thuggish government overreach, which really makes it impossible for the press to do its job. The IRS could rise to that level, but there are things we don't know. Who instigated the pressure on the Tea Party groups?", "Who in Treasury and maybe in the White House knew or if anybody knew in Treasury and the White House? And how soon were things known and did anybody try to cover it up? So those are open questions. I more or less agree with E.J. on Benghazi. I think the talking points thing is probably a non-scandal. There still is the larger issue of why we didn't come to support Ambassador Stephens when he was in peril. But the talking points are mostly nothing.", "Could I just say on the IRS, obviously any kind of political targeting by the IRS is wrong and that's why the IRS story is so serious. But I think we're not talking enough about the other scandal with the IRS, which is a whole lot of these groups, and I'm talking liberal, conservative, socialist, libertarian, almost all these groups should not get 501c4 status.", "Let's remember, we're not talking about the IRS going out and auditing conservative groups. These were groups applying for a status that gives them special privileges. The original law said that 501c4 status should be granted to groups that engage exclusively in social welfare activities. Five years later, the IRS changed that to primarily. Well, no wonder these IRS agents were confused.", "Imagine someone rewriting their marriage vow to say exclusivity when it comes to faithfulness really means only being primarily faithful. So there's a problem at the core of this that goes beyond the fact there shouldn't be political targeting. On the press, I agree. This is vast overreach. It's just not clear to me what the attorney general's role is in this.", "And I want to actually jump in on that because we did see some tension this week come out in an exchange between Attorney General Holder and Congressman Darrell Issa at a House Judiciary Committee hearing. Holder was in the midst of answering a question from the congressman about an issue that actually is not related to the AP leaks. Here it is.", "I'm sure there must have been a good reason why only the two and from parts were...", "Yes. You didn't want us to see the details. Mr. Attorney General...", "No, no, no.", "In knowing the two and from...", "That's what you typically do.", "...knowing the two and...", "No, I'm not going to stop talking now. Characterize something as something ...else (unintelligible).", "Mr. Chairman, would you inform the witness as to the rules of this committee?", "...is inappropriate and is too consistent with the way in which you conduct yourself as a member of Congress. It's unacceptable and it's shameful.", "And, of course, the subtext here is that Congressman Issa is the lawmaker who helped lead a successful effort in the House to hold the attorney general in contempt of Congress. David, what did this exchange reveal to you?", "Yeah, I actually don't think - so far, none of these scandals have gotten to some of the principles - President Obama, Attorney General Holder. I think they're more about government than about impeachment and some of the ridiculous things that are being said. They're more about how government agencies work.", "And what we've seen is in this climate, some government agencies have a tendency to work in unrestrained behavior, desiring to control other people in really an egregious way without any sense of self-policing. And I think that's the problem in the Justice Department. There was just no internal restraint.", "And I think that's also a bit of the problem in the IRS, no sense of internal restraint, that power does corrupt and that people who hold power really have to be very restrained in how they use it. And so it's just a laxity of culture here. But I do not think it's something that directly implicates a lot of the famous policymakers in Washington.", "E.J.?", "First on the Issa-Holder thing, I mean, Congress has really had it out for Eric Holder. And remember on this leak investigation, a year ago they were denouncing him as somebody who couldn't conduct a fair leak investigation because it involved the Obama administration. So they go all out on the leak and, as I say, I think overreach in - way overreach in the subpoena. And now they're on Holder for doing that, the very people who have supported very aggressive actions by government on anything having to do with national security, I'm talking about the Republicans.", "I very much disagree with David in trying to view all of this in one big government prism. I think the IRS agents were wrong, but I think they're dealing with a law that - a regulation that is almost impossible to understand as it's been interpreted. These 501c4s sprouted up after the Citizens United case, and they were struggling, and they made some bad decisions.", "But I don't link all of these together the way David does.", "So the question is, does the public? I mean, the other political conversation happening this week more generally has been about trust in President Obama, and has something substantial been lost in these last few days?", "I would say certainly distrust in government has to rise. Listen, the Tea Party and members - Republican members of Congress have been claiming for a long, long time that they were being politically targeted or at least targeted by the IRS. Now it turns out there's a lot of substance. For whatever motivation, that was absolutely true.", "And so how can you - that'll - this is a very cynical country about government right now, and a lot of these storylines, the overreach in the national security state, the IRS and the Justice Department, these underline the basic cynicism and distrust people have toward their government.", "E.J., you say these aren't linked, but what do you see here?", "Well politically, especially the IRS scandal, will be great for the Republicans because it remotivates the Tea Party, which we hadn't heard much from recently. In terms of Obama, I think he started the week in a deep hole. I think he's better off now than he was five days ago because he moved very aggressively to release all the emails on Benghazi. He's clearly gotten out front on the IRS. He's used words just like the Republicans used in denouncing this.", "And he is now for - he's again re-endorsed a shield law to protect journalists. So I think what started out as a really awful week for President Obama ended up as an unfortunate week, but it got a little better as it went along.", "And David, the last few seconds to you. On Republicans, we had House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former House speaker, this week say that they need to be careful of overreach. What are you thinking here?", "Yeah, they haven't - a  few people have certainly gone there, but they do have to worry about it. But the people responsible for the scandal generally are blamed for the scandal. I would say one thing about President Obama. He really does have to have some positive agenda to displace this news. Speeding up infrastructure programs is a make-believe policy.", "Part of the problem with this is there's a policy vacuum, an agenda vacuum coming out of the White House.", "That's David Brooks of The New York Times and E.J.

The Obama administration announced today that it is rejecting a permit for a controversial pipeline to carry Canadian oil to the Gulf of Mexico. Just before Christmas, Congress set a tight deadline for the White House to make its decision. NPR correspondent Elizabeth Shogren joins us to explain why this won't be the last that we hear of the Keystone XL pipeline. Elizabeth, why did the Obama administration reject the permit?", "Well, President Obama said in a statement that the rushed and arbitrary deadline set by Congress didn't give his administration any other choice. This is a $7 billion project that's been years in the making and there was a hitch last year when Nebraska said it didn't want the pipeline to go through an important aquifer. The company agreed to find another route through that state and it hasn't done that yet, so the administration can't finish its review of the project.", "If the administration had approved the permit in its unfinished state, the decision would have been vulnerable to legal challenges.", "So if today's announcement by the Obama administration is rejecting the pipeline more on procedural than substantive grounds, that would not be the kind of firm ideological rejection that, say, the environmental movement was hoping for.", "That's right. The administration said they weren't rejecting the permit on its merits. The State Department said the Canadian company can reapply or other companies can apply for a pipeline. TransCanada has been saying that it is - TransCanada is the company that's behind this pipeline - they've been saying it's very committed to this project. They've sunk a lot of money into it and I can't imagine that they're going to be easily deterred.", "The company wasn't ready to go ahead with the project now anyways since it's still looking for a route through Nebraska and it doesn't expect to have that new route until the fall.", "How might this decision affect the president politically?", "Well, it's a mixed bag. Environmentalists were elated. They felt that the president hasn't done enough for them on global warming and this is a big - they consider it a huge gift for them. On the other hand, labor unions are furious, some at least, because they thought that this project did include the prospect for lots of jobs, especially for laborers and construction workers and so they're disappointed and they call it a job killer.", "And the reaction from the oil industry?", "Well, even before the announcement officially came out, representatives from the oil industry were bashing the president, saying that he was chasing away jobs and chasing away a massive investment in the economy at a time when we need it so badly. The industry also says that this will stand in the way of America weaning itself from imports of oil from unfriendly and unstable countries.", "So the president has announced that unable to make a decision within the timeframe imposed by Congress, he must reject a permit now for the pipeline. What is likely to happen next?", "Well, congressional Republicans are meeting to come up with their strategy. They say they're going to keep pushing for this pipeline to become a reality and to try to make it - try to fast-track it anyway they can. And they're also surely going to continue to use this issue as a way to attack the president for not doing enough to create jobs in the country.", "Okay. Thank you, Elizabeth.

And, in fact, we reported him about 3 1/2 years ago.", "And so Zaharan's speeches were available online. And it came to your attention because what was in the speeches, the tone of his rhetoric.", "Yeah. That is right because he has been uploading a number of videos on YouTube. He was calling, basically, for the killing off of nonbelievers.", "You talk about wanting the authorities to take action against Zaharan. But did you get any sense in recent years that he was attracting followers or that you saw men being drawn to radical groups?", "At the time, you know, we thought that Zaharan was a loner and that, you know, he had no major following as such, except a few people in his hometown. But in 2018, December, we realized that there were basically a bunch of youths going around and damaging Buddhist statues. And we found out that Zaharan has been their mentor.", "So this was in one particular village. You're saying that back in December of 2018, there were some young people who defaced some Buddhist statues.", "Yes.", "And this raised alarm for you and others.", "Yes. And we basically went back to the authorities with all the facts we had.", "I understand that in the aftermath of the Easter Sunday attacks, you and other Muslim leaders have also gathered to figure out how to respond to this incident. What kinds of actions are you considering?", "See, this Easter Sunday attack came as a shock to the Muslim community because we have never had this kind of extremism within the community. We are asking all our mosques to ensure that they have a vigilance committee to see whether there is any untoward activities by anybody and to report them directly to the police or to call a hotline, which we will establish, to address possible threats.", "So the idea is that each mosque would have a small committee that you said you're calling a vigilance committee.

It gave him a spot in the lineup every fifth day guaranteed and it gave him an identity.", "But then he was traded last December to San Diego and thus began the Red Sox problems in the spring.

On the other hand, the fact is that these 13 federal agencies did produce this extremely blunt report. And so the question that I then have is, is there a track on which progress can be made without executive leadership? Or is that just a fantasy?", "No, absolutely there is. And, in fact, one of the sort of good pieces of news when you look at what's happening in the United States is that just based on what states are doing - individual states and cities and municipalities - and our largest companies who are all acting on climate change. It turns out that even without Trump's support we will still meet our obligations under the Paris accord.

Those early humans would have looked almost exactly like us, but they didn't act fully human at that time or think like we do, and even though we are, and we were, are the same species.", "So what happened?

My next guest talks our beginnings in his new book \"Masters of the Planet: The Search for our Human Origins.\" Ian Tattersall is also curator of the Spitzer Hall of Human Origins here at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY.", "Thank you, Ira.", "Tell us, you know, tell us why - I was really shocked that we are still the same homo sapiens. Well, how does that work?", "Well, species normally have quite a substantial longevity. I mean, 200,000 years is not a long time for a species to be in existence. But the earliest evidence we have of people who look just like us comes from sites in Africa that date to about 200,000 years ago.", "And so what does it mean that they were not fully human that we would think of today?", "Interestingly enough the archeological record that goes along with these early fossils that we can recognize as homo sapiens is pretty much the same as the fossil record that was left by the - the archeological record that was left by their contemporaries. Two hundred thousand years ago, there were several different kinds of hominid in the world, and in fact there had been several different kinds of hominid living simultaneously in the world really all the way back to the very beginning of the human family, something like seven million years ago.", "The human family tree, it turns out, has been very bushy. Every couple of years, I've had to redo my family tree of the human group, and I think I'm up to 23 species now that most people would agree are recognizable. And three or four of them at least have been in simultaneous occupation in the world at any one time.", "And so why did one succeed while the other 22 did not?", "I think it has to do with the fact that, at some point in its existence, Homo sapiens became an insuperable competitor. It became very intolerant of competition and able to sort of enforce that intolerance. And that involves a major behavioral change. And I think it was a change, basically, in cognition - the change in the way in which human beings process information about the world in their minds.", "And what was that? What was the advantage that they got?", "I think...", "Was it a brain - the brain changed different, or what happened?", "It wasn't simply a matter of brain size. Thirty thousand years ago, there were Neanderthals still existing in the world, a separate species of human that came into existence about the same time as Homo sapiens, but separately. We were - we evolved in Africa. The Neanderthals evolved in Europe, and they had brains just as big as ours. But they didn't behave in the same way that we behave today, and they behaved more like the early Homo sapiens that we find in Africa and...", "How do you figure out how a human who lived 150,000 years ago thought or behaved? How do you know that?", "Well, that's the key question, of course. And all we have to judge from - if we can't judge from raw brain size, what we can judge from is the archeological leavings of these early hominids. The material evidence they left of their behavior, which is mostly in the form of stone artifacts and of campsites and so forth, which give us some idea of the complexity of what they were doing. And the Neanderthals were great stone craftsmen. No question about it.", "But they were kind of stereotyped, in a way, in which they made tools. They didn't make tools with a kind of creativity and the inventiveness that was characteristics of the human beings who came along later.", "We've heard so many times that, you know, if a Neanderthal were next to you on the subway, you wouldn't know the difference. Is that true, or is that folk - urban folklore?", "To an extent. I think I would recognize a Neanderthal...", "...if it was next to me in the subway.", "And you have every day, on the - right.", "But, you know, we have considerable experience here in making reconstructions of ancient hominids - reconstructing how they looked in life. And it's very true, that when you sculpt a face onto a skull, you layer on the underlying tissues, the muscles and so forth and then the superficial tissues, and you've got this bold creature with no hair on its head or on its face. The look is very distinctive. It looks very, very different from Homo sapiens. Then when you put the wig on, it's much harder to tell apart.", "So that, in fact, we can make this kind of reconstruction and show it in a way in which it stands out from the rest. But if it sat next to you on the subway, you might not have too much of a notion.", "I'm Ira Flatow, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. If you'd like to ask a question, you can step up to the microphones we have there. We'd be very happy to talk with Ian Tattersall whose new book is \"Masters of the Planet: The Search for Our Human Origins.\" And on the cover, you show three different hands. What are you trying to illustrate with that three different hands?", "Well, the cover came as a bit of a surprise to me. As a matter of fact...", "I hate it when that happens.", "But...", "But I think it's a very dramatic cover. In fact, what it shows is the hand of, I think, a gibbon or a siamang, and a hand of a chimpanzee, and the hand of a modern human. You can see the hand proportions are very different. And what you have there is two higher primates, two apes with very long, slender hands. So they're very good for grasping branches in the trees. And you'll notice that our own hand is much, much shorter. In fact, it's much broader, The axis of the hand is across, rather than long. And that is what makes it possible for us to manipulate items in the precise way in which we can do and make those stone tools that our predecessors made.", "You write that one important factor that is totally unique to hominids and is paradoxical is the possession of complex culture, especially as it's expressed in technology. Can you explain a little bit more about that?", "Yeah. Obviously, culture is in the strictest sense is not confined to human beings. Chimpanzees, for example, in different parts of Africa pass along, from one generation to another - they pass along particular ways of doing things. But no other creature has a culture of the depth and the richness that human beings have. And human beings have taken culture to a whole new level. And we have come - biologically, we've come a very long way in a very short time.", "And I think it's culture that has allowed us to do that because having culture as a buffer against the environment that's allowed different kinds of hominid to spread out over the world and occupy some very marginal environments, which they very often have had to abandoned. There's been this history of fragmenting of the human population which is exactly the circumstances under which you'd expect a lot of evolutionary change to happen.", "You also write in your book, that one of the great modifying - or catalysts for change, has been climate change over the years. Can you tell us about that?", "Yes, indeed. The last several million years have been a time of increasingly unsettled climates. The climate has gotten cold and warm on a larger timescale, as well on smaller timescales too, changing the environment. Any hominid groups staying in the same place would successively encounter lots and lots of different environments and it's ability to accommodate to environmental change which is one of the ingredients for our success in the world. But you have this effect of climate change and fragmentation of populations - human populations couldn't remain in one place forever.", "If an ice sheet comes and covers the place where you're living, you're not going to be staying there. You're going to be moving somewhere else more congenial. It's this effect of environmental, climatic and environment change on populations that really has provided the circumstances under which evolutionary innovations could be fixed in populations.", "After the break, lots more on human origins with my guest Ian Tattersall, author of the new book \"Masters of the Planet.\" Stay with us.", "I'm Ira Flatow, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.", "Welcome back. We're here at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, talking about the new book \"Masters of the Planet: The Search for Our Human Origins\" with my guest Ian Tattersall. He's also curator of the Spitzer Hall of Human Origins here at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Yes, ma'am?", "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: You have to excuse the simplicity of my question, but it's coming from a sixth-grade student of mine who asked me once: If we evolved from primates, how come there's no evidence of that evolution in primates currently?", "Well, you know, currently, we're looking at one slice in time. So there's just a sampling of a particular time point.", "Can I just interrupt for a second?", "Yeah.", "Point of reference is everybody thinks we came from monkeys.", "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Right.", "Could you clear that up for us? Did we come from monkeys?", "No. We are not descended from monkeys. But monkeys and we are descended from the same common ancestor.", "Thank you. I just want to get that out of the way.", "Right.", "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: I'll let him know.", "And the reason why, I think, for example, people say, well, why aren't chimpanzees - if it's such a good idea to get a big brain and to become human-like, why aren't chimpanzees doing the same thing? And I think, quite frankly, that the chimpanzees are already too committed to a particular kind of quadrupedal locomotion on the ground to become upright. Our ancestor was a much more generalized ancestor. It seems that upright walking was the original adaptation of the hominid group - of the general hominid group.", "And I suspect that hominids didn't start walking upright on the ground at a time when the forest cover in Africa was shrinking, simply because it was a good idea to do that. I think they've probably - the hominid ancestors probably already moved around in the trees, holding their trunks upright so that when they came down to the ground they would have been most comfortable moving upright. And clearly, that's not true for a chimpanzee today. A chimpanzee, if he wants to move over the ground, effectively, drops to all fours and moves off quadrupedally.", "Let's go to a question in the audience. Yes, sir.", "Hi. I was reading an article a while ago that was talking about whether humans will no longer have to evolve because we don't need to adjust to nature anymore because we are adjusting nature ourselves. I was wondering, what's your take on that?", "Well, I think, first of all, that the human ability to accommodate to the environment culturally meant we could go to many more different areas of the world than we would otherwise have been able to do. And therefore, we're more subject to fragmentation of our population by environmental change. That's one thing. And we evolved in this kind of, sort of, unsettled environmental picture. And human beings for the - or human precursors for the - virtually all of hominid history, have been thinly spread over the landscape.", "They have lived in very small densities, in very small groups, moving over large swaths of territory, which again, gives you good circumstances for isolation and evolutionary innovation. Since 10,000 years ago when our species became sedentary, settled down, first started living in villages, then towns and now in urban settings, our population has become huge. Our population is seven billion and increasing, and we're packed, cheek by jowl, over the surface of the Earth.", "And these are circumstances in which you could not imagine that significant new genetic innovations could become fixed. Population, the size of ours, is simply - has simply too much genetic inertia to change. So I think as long as demographic circumstances remain the same as they are today, Homo sapiens is going nowhere.", "Well, what is the mechanism that's preventing that exactly? You say we're bunched together. There are too many people together. Why is the - why does that stop evolution?", "It's extremely difficult to get the fixation of any genetic novelty arising in a very, very big population. To get the fixation of genetic novelties which arise spontaneously in populations, you really need to have a small unstable gene pool that can react to this kind of circumstance.", "Thank you for that question. Yes, ma'am.", "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I was wondering if you could talk about how technology is being applied in your field, and maybe how you're using at the museum - to keep things modern, talking about a very old topic.", "Well, the world is constantly changing, and this is true of paleoanthropology too. The human fossil record is expanding enormously. There are new discoveries that's being announced practically every week. There are new techniques of looking at all data that are becoming available online. So this is a very exciting thing to be involved in, and the problem is more a problem of keeping up with the change rather than thinking of ways to reflect that change.", "Mm-hmm. Talking with Ian Tattersall, author of \"Masters of the Planet: The Search for Our Human Origins.\" What are some of the big gaps that you think we need to fill in? Or are there gaps in our history that...", "Well, I think with every new fossil that's found, the probability decreases that anybody will come up with a new fossil, will force everybody to rewrite the textbooks. They used to be obligatory. Every time a new fossil - a human fossil was announced, that the journalist would say, oh, this is going to...", "Rewrite the textbooks.", "...rewrite the textbooks, yeah. Now, we have a really good human fossil record, and we, I think, are perceiving the general outlines as this sort of very bushy experimental tree. What's really interesting, though, is what we can do with that data we have.", "A couple of years ago, I would never have been able to imagine that people would be in a position to reconstitute the diet of the Neanderthals from the little phytoliths, the little grains of mineral material that are gained from plants that are imbedded in the calculus that forms on the Neanderthal teeth. Who would've imagine this? A dentist's nightmare has sort of become a really good source of information about what our relatives did and ate in the past. This kind of thing is happening all the time. And so I'm not seeing huge gaps to be filled, but what I'm saying is a story that is being fleshed out enormously and in ways that are really impossible to anticipate.", "Do you think - people always talk about, you know, as we get better technology, maybe we'll be able to reconstruct the DNA of something...", "Mm-hmm.", "...either, you know, the DNA of a wooly mammoth or maybe the Neanderthal.", "Mm-hmm.", "Do you think that's going to be possible some time?", "Well, hopefully, it won't be possible in my lifetime. I think it would raise too many ethical questions. Homo sapiens has had a very bad, you know, history in the way in which it has dealt with its close relatives in the fossil and the living records. I mean, Neanderthals are gone now. We're working on the chimpanzees and the orangutans and the gorillas, and after that, that was - it will be the monkeys. I...", "You mean losing them all.", "Losing them. Well...", "Losing them, yeah.", "...we really are. And my gosh, if we recreated the Neanderthal by some miracle, what would we do with it?", "You know, it would raise some really extraordinary ethical issues that we haven't even began to grapple with.", "Yeah. Question in the audience?", "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: The word paleo has been a big word on book covers these years, \"The Paleo Diets,\" et cetera, where these folks discussed that the best way for humans to eat is to eat pre-agricultural, in other words no grains, no rice, go back to the meats, go back to the protein and the fruits and the vegetables and the tubers, et cetera. Are you familiar with these books and them discussing how early people ate and how, our digestive system involved and how we should eat? Have you given that any thoughts?", "Yeah. There's always, you know, there's the Neanderthal diet, \"The Caveman Diet,\" the recommendation that you should eat this and that and the other, but what is quite extraordinary about our hominid family in general is how generalist we are. It's very interesting that there are some chimpanzee groups that live in an environments that are not too different from the kind of environment that our very early bipedal relatives lived in, and they live in a very, very different way. Chimpanzees coming out of the forest into tree-savanna surroundings eat exactly the same things that their relatives in the forest did.", "Our precursors coming out of the forest started exploiting a much wider range of foodstuffs from very early on, including, apparently, animal carcasses, at least regionally. And what this tells me is that we are incredibly generalist in terms of what we eat. So I can't imagine what you would describe a natural diet as being.", "And in your book you say that tapeworms can actually tell us something about our past diets. How does that work?", "You know, the tapeworm question is a very interesting one. We - and the idea is that we had to acquire the tapeworm from somewhere, and apparently the tapeworm that infects the human beings is related to a carnivore tapeworm. And probably, the easiest way of transmitting tapeworm cysts or whatever would have been for human beings at a very early stage to be feeding on the same carcasses that had been attacked by carnivores, again pointing towards a propensity for carnivory in early stage.", "Do you find yourself still having to defend the idea of human evolution?", "I think less often than I might fear. We have had very - we've had exhibitions on human evolution looked at by millions of people every year. We have brought original human fossils in to display to the general public to give people an idea of the richness of the record that we're dealing with, and we have run into really rather little objection from the quarter that you're suggesting.", "Yeah. Yeah. I'm Ira Flatow, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR. Let's go to the, yes, the mic there.", "Hi, Beth Ann Freed(ph). Back to the food, I've heard few things recently about how cooking has affected our evolution and how we - I mean, I work with teeth and I see that our teeth aren't good for much but cooked food. Talking about all of these human ancestral cousins, how many of us had fire? And talking about the generalist nature of diet, which came first, being a generalists or cooking, and how did those come together?", "You know, that's an excellent question. I think the generalist tendency probably came first because we know our ancestors of three and a half, 4 million years were, presumably now, pursuing a generalist diet. The cooking argument is a very compelling one though, but it's entirely circumstantial. We know that about 2 million years ago, human or hominid brain sizes began to expand. For the first two or 3 million, maybe 4 million years of hominid evolution, brain size relative to body size had flatlined and remained basically in the ape range. And then suddenly, about 2 million years ago, the curve turned sharply upwards, and the human brain sizes, on average, start getting bigger very fast.", "Now, there's a penalty to developing a big brain. We may think we have big brains, and so it's got to be a good idea, but, actually, a big brain is a very costly organ to have. Our brains are about 2 percent of our body weight, but they can use up to 25 percent of all the energy...", "No kidding.", "...that we consume. And so there is a cost to be paid. And there is an argument that you could not have started to increase brain size without increasing the quality of the diet, and the most obvious way to increase the quality of the diet is actually to use cooking to make the nutrients in the diet much more available than they are in the raw state, and this is a very compelling argument. The only problem is that we have no physical evidence...", "It's just a theory.", "...to support it.", "Yeah. It's a theory about how you can get more...", "Yeah. It's a theory and it's a very beguiling theory, and it could even be true, but we don't have the physical evidence that we would want to substantiate it. In fact, there are people who argue that regular cooking came in quite late. We only begin to find campfires routinely as part of human occupation sites about 400,000 years ago. There is one instance in - from Israel reported of a succession of hearths dating from about 800,000 years ago, but it's an outlier until about 400,000 years ago. So between 2 million years ago when brains started to expand and 400,000 years ago, there's not a lot of really compelling evidence that people were cooking. Inferentially, it's a great story, but we're still looking for the hard evidence.", "But in science, a theory is not good enough. You need to have the evidence for it.", "Well, you know, in science, you know, we make a big thing out of science dealing with testable hypotheses and information, and yet there's a lot that we believe in science that we can't directly test. All we ask is that it be - that what we believe is consistent with what we can't test. And in that perspective, the circumstantial argument for cooking, it still retains a certain amount of attraction.", "Yeah.

And that's why when we get on the air and this tornado, just like the May 3rd of 1999 tornado - I know our chief meteorologist, Gary England, at the station probably made a statement that saved a lot of lives.
